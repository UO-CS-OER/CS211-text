title:  Negative Binary Numbers

In [the prior section](06_1_Bits) 
on binary representation and manipulation we 
discussed only positive integers and zero. 
Negative numbers complicate things slightly. 

## Representing a negative integer

How should we represent -1 in binary?
How about -42? 

### Sign and magnitude: Seemed like a good idea at the time

A simple approach would be to reserve one binary
digit as a _sign bit_.  For example, in an 8-bit integer,
10000001 could represent -1, and 10000101 could represent -5.  
That is called _sign and magnitude_ representation.  It is 
simple, but it has some problems. 

In sign and magnitude representation we end up with 00000000
for positive zero and 10000000 for negative zero.  But ... really, 
negative zero? This is a pretty clear indication that sign and magnitude 
representation is going to have other problems.  And it does. 

From the perspective of a computer designer, sign and magnitude 
representation adds a lot of 
complication to the circuitry needed for arithmetic.  Consider
that somehow when we add $$00000001_2$$ (1)  and $$10000001_2$$ (-1) 
we should get $$00000000_2$$ (0).  The circuitry that adds 
positive integers is not going to do that, so special purpose 
circuitry for arithmetic on negative numbers would be required. 
Chip designers hate that. 

A representation that chip designers can be happy with should 
add as little complication as possible to CPU circuitry. Adding 
a negative number to a positive number, or a negative number 
to a negative number, should work exactly the same as adding 
two positive numbers.  Which brings us to two's complement 
notation. 

## Two's complement: A better way 

The representation for negative numbers actually used in virtually all modern
digital computers is
[two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement).   In this notation, the 8-bit representation of
-1 is 11111111 and the 8-bit representation of 1 is, 
of course, 00000001.  If we add them, we "carry the one" all the way
into the 9th (non-existant) digit, where it is lost, 
and we get 00000000.  Addition and subtraction can work in the ordinary way, with
no special cases for negative numbers. 

The essence of two's complement representation is that, while the
value of digit $$p$$ is normally $$2^p$$, the value of the
very leftmost digit is $$-2^p$$. 

In an 8-bit signed integer, bit 7 represents $$-(2^7)$$, or -128. 
The signed 8-bit number 10000110, therefore, is 
$$-(2^7) + 2^2 + 2^1$$ = -128 + 4 + 2 = -122.  

![-122 = -128 + 4 + 2](img_06_02/twos_comp.svg)

We said above that an 8-bit representation of -1 would 
be 11111111.  We can see that this is because the leftmost 
bit (still called the _sign bit_) represents -128, and the 
remaining bits represent 127, so that together they represent 
-1.  

### Check your understanding

If 11111111 is -1, what is the representation of -2? 

What range of values can be represented by by an 8-bit 
integer using the two's complement notation? 

### Python 'bin' lies about negative numbers

If you count on the Python `bin` function to check 
the binary representation of integers, you will 
encounter a problem:  Python's `bin` function uses 
sign and magnitude notation, not two's complement, 
to represent a negative integer as a string of 
`0` and `1` characters.  In this way the Python 
`bin` function can always produce a string that starts 
with the character `1`, except for the binary value 0. 
It does not need to show the leading zeros on a positive 
integer, and it does not need to show a long string of `1`
characters for a small negative integer. 

```
>>> bin(-1)
'-0b1'
>>> bin(-2)
'-0b10'
```

This is usually convenient, especially considering the real internal 
representation of negative one in Python is likely to 
start with at least 31 1 bits. It can be misleading, 
however, when you are trying to reason carefully about 
the actual representation of negative numbers. 
 
## Sign extension

Note that when we describe the representation of a negative 
binary number, we need to say how many bits are in the 
representation.  The representation of -1 as an 
8-bit signed integer is 11111111, but the representation 
of -1 as a 16-bit signed integer 
is 1111111111111111.  I do not want to type the representation 
of -1 as a 32-bit signed integer, or as a 64-bit signed integer, 
but you can probably guess what it looks like. 

Suppose we have 3-bit signed integers. Then 101 
represents $$-2^2 + 2^0$$ = -4 + 1 = -3.  Suppose I want to store 
this same value in a 5-bit signed integer. The 
new value will become 11101, that is, 
-16 + 8 + 4 + 1 = -3.  

![Sign extending 3-bit negative integer to 5 bits](img_06_02/sign-extend-neg.svg)

You can likely see the pattern:  If we want to store a 
signed n-bit value in a larger m-bit field, we must 
pad with 1 digits on the left. 
More generally, what we pad with is the sign bit.
Thus the 3-bit negative number 101 is padded out 
to the 5-bit negative 11101, while the 3-bit 
positive number 011 is padded out to the 
5-bit positive number 00011.  

![Sign-extending 3-bit positive integer to 5 bits](img_06_02/sign-extend-pos.svg)

This is called 
_sign extension_. 

If we go the other way, we simply chop off bits on the 
left, whether they are 0 or 1.  If the bits we chop off
are not all the same, and the same as the remaining sign 
bit, then the number does not fit in the smaller field! 

## Packing and extracting bit fields 

When we pack multiple values 
into an integer, we must be careful to 
determine whether that value should 
be interpreted as a _signed_ integer 
 in which the leftmost bit is the sign bit, 
 representing a negative power of 2, or 
an _unsigned_ integer in which all the bits
represent positive powers of two. 

Suppose we use four bits, bits 0..3, to 
represent an integer.  We might treat that field as an 
_unsigned_ integer that can range from 0 to 15, or we might 
treat it as a _signed_ integer that can range from -8 to 7. 
If we treat it as an unsigned integer, the masking and shifting
can work exactly as described in the
[the prior chapter](06_1_Bits.md), but we cannot represent 
negative values.  If we treat it as a signed 
integer, then we must add a sign extension step when we 
extract it.

To pack a signed value into a field, we don't need to do 
anything special except be sure to mask the value to 
chop off any extra 1 bits on the left. For example, if we 
want to store a signed 3-bit value `x` in bits 3..5 of 
`w`, assuming those bits of `w` are initially zero, 
we would need to mask off any high bits, like this: 

```
x_masked = x & 0b111
x_shifted = x_masked << 3
w = w | x_shifted
```

It is only on extraction that we must perform 
sign extension.  For example, if `x` in the 
preceding line was -1, and `w` is an 8-bit 
value 0, then `w` after the code 
above will contain `00111000`.  We want to extract 
the field in bits 3..5, holding value `111`, 
interpret it again as -1.  To do that, we must 
extend the sign bit (the initial 1) however 
far it takes to fill the word into which we are 
extracting that field.   

Implementing sign extension in Python is slightly odd. 
You must understand why and 
when to perform sign extension, but I will provide a 
sign extension function that you can call. 

## Summary 

In all modern digital computers, negative integers are 
represented with the _two's complement_ system.  In this 
system, the _sign bit_ represents a negative power of two, 
and all other bits represent positive powers of two.  

Two's complement notation is very convenient and efficient 
for chip designers, because arithmetic with negative and 
positive numbers work exactly the same, with no extra 
circuitry.

When we pack multiple small integers into an integer value, 
we must be careful about whether we intend a field to 
represent a signed value or an unsigned value.  If the 
field represents an unsigned value, then each bit $$p$$ 
represents $$2^p$$.  An unsigned value with $$k$$ bits 
ranges from $$0$$ to $$2^k-1$$.  
 If the field represents a signed 
value, then the _sign bit_ represents $$-2^p$$
and all other bits $$p$$ represent $$2^p$$. 

When 
we pack a signed value into a smaller field, 
we mask off any extra 1 bits on the left. 
When we 
extract a signed value into a larger memory word, 
we must _sign extend_ it, filling all bits to the left of 
the sign bit of the smaller field with duplicates of the sign bit. 

When we use the Python `bin` function, we get a string 
representation based on sign and magnitude notation, 
and not an accurate representation of the actual 
internal two's-complement representation.
