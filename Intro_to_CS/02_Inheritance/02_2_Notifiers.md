## Untangling GUIs with Model-View-Controller

As we build larger projects, it becomes more 
and more important to divide them into parts, 
and to control the ways in which one part 
depends on another.  We must do this not only 
at the level of individual functions and classes, 
but also at the coarser grain level of 
*modules* in separate files.  

A particular case where we often need to 
divide a program into coarse-grain modules 
is applications with graphical user interfaces. 
Suppose, for example, that we are building an 
application that we want to run on MacOS, Linux, 
and Windows, or on Android and iPhone:  There are 
some parts that will need to be specialized for 
each platform, and (hopefully) some parts that can 
be almost or fully independent of the platform.
We don't want to jumble those parts all up in 
the same source files! 

Typically we might want at least three 
different files, or sets of files: 

* The graphics interaction component.  This 
  part would handle basic graphical 
  interaction tasks like drawing a shape on 
  the screen and determining which shape a 
  user touched or clicked.  It might contain 
  classes like "Box" and "Menu", and we 
  might be able to reuse it for several different 
  interactive programs.  It might depend on 
  a specific platform (say, Cocoa under 
  MacOS or the equivalent Windows toolkit), and 
  thus for a multi-platform application we
  might need more than one version of the 
  graphics component. 
  
* Application logic, often called the *model* 
  component.  If our application is for pizza 
  design, this is the component that knows that
  pineapple should never be added to pizza. As 
  much as possible, we would like this component
  to be independent of the graphical interaction, 
  and reusable across platforms. 
  
* Interaction logic, often called the *view* 
  component.  This is the part that knows that 
  a pizza is round and that tomato sauce is red. 
  It does not know much about pizzas and it does 
  not know how the graphics component draws 
  a circle, but it knows that it should draw 
  circles of different sizes to indicate possible
  pizza sizes, and that when the user clicks on
  the middle circle it indicates a choice of a 
  medium size pizza. 
  
As soon as we start to sketch out the 
relations among these modules, we 
see a potential problem.  The relation between the
view module and graphics is fine: The view 
module will need to `import` the graphics module 
to gain access to functions and classes for 
drawing pizzas.  But what about the relation 
between the view module and the model (pizza) module? 
Should the view module `import` the model
module, or vice versa?  We want the graphical 
depiction to be updated when the pizza changes, 
so it seems like the model needs access to the 
view to trigger updates.  But when the user 
clicks the picture of a medium size pizza, it 
seems like the view needs access to the model to 
set pizza size to medium.  Each component 
seems to depend on the other. 

We need to break this circular dependence between 
model and view.  There is a common, fairly 
standard way to break it, called the model-view-controller 
design pattern. 
  
## Notifiers 

Functions or methods in the view component 
need to call methods or functions in the 
model component when the user interacts, e.g., 
by touching or clicking a shape on the screen 
or by pressing a key on the keyboard.  The 
model component will then do something and 
call methods or functions in the view component 
to indicate that some parts of screen representation 
should be updated.  Thus parts of each module 
call parts in the other module.

Calls between the two components is 
not a problem in itself, unless there 
is an infinite recursive loop.  We can 
avoid that easily enough. The 
problem is that each needs to "see"
the methods or functions in the other, 
which typically means each module 
needs to `import` the other.   We need 
to break the `import` cycle. 

It is possible for functions or methods in 
module to call the other without importing that
module.  The trick involves inheritance and 
an abstract *Listener* class. 

Let's suppose we want a method in class 
`M` to call a method in class `V`, and a 
method in class `V` to call a different method 
in class `M`.  Note that this may not be 
recursive at all:  `M.f` calls `V.g`, and 
`V.g` calls `M.h`; there is a cycle among 
the objects but not among the methods. 

```python
class M:
    def __init__(self):
        self.the_V = None

    def hook_up(self, v: 'V'):
        self.the_V = v

    def f(self):
        self.the_V.g(self)

    def h(self):
        print("What goes around, comes around")

class V:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def g(self, an_m: M):
        an_m.h()

v = V()
m = M()
m.hook_up(v)
m.f()
```

If we place `M` and `V` in different modules, 
each module will have to `import` the other. 

![V and M call each others methods](img/M-V-cycle.svg)

We can't break the cycle in calls (and we 
don't want to), but we can break the cycle 
in `import` by interposing a third module 
with abstract base classes.  We can 
think of the abstract base classes as 
defining some wires that can be connected 
in the concrete classes. 

```python
class Listener:
    """Abstract base class for classes in View component"""
    def notify(self, event: str):
        raise NotImplementedError("Notify has not been implemented")

class ModelElement:
    """Abstract base class for classes in Model component"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.listeners = []

    def add_listener(self, listener: Listener):
        self.listeners.append(listener)

    def notify_all(self, event: str):
        for listener in self.listeners:
            listener.notify(self, event)


class M(ModelElement):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Might have more of its own initialization here

    def f(self):
        # Instead of self.the_V.g()
        self.notify_all("g")

    def h(self):
        print("What goes around, comes around")


class V(Listener):
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def notify(self, an_m: M, event: str):
        # Instead of a call to method g, we
        # might get an event "g"
        if event == "g":
            an_m.h()
```

The revised version is more complex, 
but it essentially duplicates the calling 
relation between methods in `M` and `V` from 
above.  There are a couple of differences:
Instead of the `M` object having a reference 
to exactly one `V` element, it can be hooked 
to zero or more `V` elements (the `listeners`
list).  Instead of calling `V.g`, it now 
*notifies* the `V` object of a `g` event 
(and now the `V` object must interpret the 
event in its `notify` method).  Overall, 
though, the behavior is the same: 

```python
v = V()
m = M()
m.add_listener(v)
m.f()
```

produces the output 

``` 
What goes around, comes around
```

What we have gained from this indirect 
calling arrangement is the ability to 
divide the code into three modules, 
with no cycles in the `import` relation: 

![Three modules for Model-View-Controller](img/MVC-classes.svg)

## Model-View-Controller (MVC)

Structures like that described above, 
with "event notification" taking the place 
of some direct method calls, are common 
in object-oriented programs.  They are used 
for many purposes besides graphical interaction, 
but their use in interactive programs is so 
common that the pattern has a name: 
*Model-View-Controller*, often 
abbreviated to *MVC*. 

In the MVC structure (also called a *design pattern*), 
the application logic is in the *model* 
component.  The model component calls its 
`notify_all` method with each event that may be 
significant to the interaction, but (as far as 
possible) is not concerned with details of the 
interaction.  The *view* component comprises 
a set of listeners that interpret and act on 
events.  View classes may also make calls
on objects in the model, for example to replace 
tomato sauce with pesto.  (Thus the view is 
dependent on the model, but the model is 
independent of the view.) The view component
also makes calls on the graphics component, 
isolating it from the model component.  (Thus MVC
makes it much easier to build a multi-platform 
interactive application, or to switch between 
graphical toolkits.)

Although the MVC *pattern* is very common, 
there are many variations.  In our example
above, we used strings to represent events. 
We could have used an `Enum` class, or 
created an `Event` class with a subclass for 
each kind of event.  The possible events, 
and the information that must be conveyed 
along with each event, vary widely from 
application to application.  The pattern 
is fairly easy to spot, and the method 
names `add_listener`, `notify`, and `notify_all`
are fairly standard, but you will still need 
to read the code fairly carefully to 
understand all the details.  

## Summary

Large programs must be broken into parts 
(modules)
that we can work on separately.  When 
we work as a team, we want each developer
to be able to work on their own module
as independently as possible.  We also want 
to be able to test and debug one module without 
understanding all the other modules, 
and ideally we would like to be able to 
reuse some modules and to replace one module 
entirely without changing others (e.g., 
replacing a view component that uses one 
graphics library with a view component that
uses a different graphics library).  

*Model-View-Controller* is a *design pattern* 
that allows us to achieve that modularity 
for interactive applications.  
One of more modules in the *model* component 
are responsible for application logic, and 
for creating *events* that may be relevant 
to the *view* component.  The *view* component
is responsible for interaction, and isolates 
the *model* from the graphics library.  
Abstract base classes for the model and view 
components can be placed in a separate module, 
breaking what would otherwise be a cycle 
in the `import` relation.
