title: Class Hierarchies and Inheritance
---

## Subclasses

Sometimes we need a specialized version of 
a class, or multiple variations on a class. 
Rather than modifying the existing class, 
we can create a new class that *inherits* 
from the existing class. 

Suppose, for example, that we wanted a 
class `Square` that is like a rectangle but 
can be created from a single point and a size. 
We can specify that a `Square` is a kind of 
`Rect`:

```python
class Square(Rect):
    def __init__(self, anchor: Point, size: Number):
        self.min_pt = anchor
        self.max_pt = self.min_pt + Point(size, size)
        self.size = size
``` 

`Square` objects have the `min_pt` and `max_pt` 
*instance variables* of `Rect`, plus a new 
instance variable `size`.  
All the methods of `Rect` are also available for 
`Square`, including the *magic* methods like `__str__`.  

```python
p1 = Point(3, 5)
sq = Square(p1, 5)
print(sq)
```


Running this code gives us

```
Rect((3, 5), (8, 10))
```

## Overriding

Maybe we don't want `print(sq)` to print a 
string beginning with `Rect`.  Maybe we want 
`Square` to have it's own `__str__` method. 

```python
    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return f"Square({str(self.min_pt)}, {self.size})"
```

The new `__str__` method of `Square` *overrides* the 
`__str__` method of the `Rect` Now the same code as above 

```python
p1 = Point(3, 5)
sq = Square(p1, 5)
print(sq)
s2 = sq.translate(Point(2,2))
print(s2)
```

prints

```
Square((3, 5), 5)
Rect((5, 7), (10, 12))
```

The first `print` command uses the new 
`__str__` method. 
The `translate` method is still inherited from 
`Rect`, and still returns a `Rect` object rather 
than a `Square`, so the second `print` command 
is printing that `Rect` object.

We can also add 
new methods that are not present in `Rect`.  For example, we 
might simply want to add a method that returns the length 
of a side: 

```python
    def side(self) -> Number:
        return self.size
```

A method that is defined only in the `Square` subclass 
can of course use instance variables that are likewise 
only in that subclass.   Now we can write 

```python
sq = Square(Point(2,2), 2)
sq.side()
```

and we will get the expected result, `2`.  However, if 
we type 

```python
r = Rect(Point(2,2), Point(4,4))
r.side()
```

we will get an error message: 

```
AttributeError: 'Rect' object has no attribute 'side'
```

The Python debugger refers to both instance variables and methods 
as *attributes*.  In this case it looked for the 
class of `r` and found it was a `Rect`, and it looked 
in class `Rect` for method `side` and did not find it. 


The inherited `translate` method still returns a `Rect`: 

```python
    def translate(self, delta: Point) -> "Rect":
        """New rectangle offset from this one by delta as movement vector"""
        return Rect(self.min_pt + delta, self.max_pt + delta)
```

 It seems more reasonable for 
translation of a `Square` to give us a `Square`, 
so we can again *override* the 
 inherited method with a more specialized version: 

```python
    def translate(self, delta: Point) -> "Square":
        return Square(self.min_pt + delta, self.size)
```

Now if we again enter 

```python
p1 = Point(3, 5)
sq = Square(p1, 5)
print(sq)
s2 = sq.translate(Point(2,2))
print(s2)
```
we will get 

``` 
Square((3, 5), 5)
Square((5, 7), 5)
```

## The Liskov Substitution Principle

Can we override methods any way 
we like?  For example, could we have have written 
the following definition of `translate` for 
class `Square`?

```python
    def translate(self, dx: Number, dy: Number) -> "Square":
        delta = Point(dx, dy)
        return Square(self.min_pt + delta, self.size)
```

Python would allow this, but it is a _very bad idea_. 
In Python, as in many object-oriented languages, 
we expect a *subclass* to also act as a *subtype*. 

What does it mean for one class to be a subtype 
of another?  The widely accepted answer is that 
a subtype may safely be used wherever its 
supertype could be used.  For example, if `Square`
is not only a subclass of `Rect`, but also a 
subtype of `Rect`, then any code that would behave 
correctly with a value `v` that is a `Rect` should 
also act correctly if the value of `v` is a `Square`. 
We could say "A `Square`s is a `Rect`s", and in 
fact some programmers call subtyping the *is-a* relation. 
This is also called the *Liskov substitution principle*, 
for Nancy Liskov of M.I.T. who proposed it. 

For a `Square` to be usable everywhere a `Rect` is usable, 
each method overridden in `Square` must be compatible with 
the corresponding method in `Rect`.  
What does it mean for the `translate` of `Square` to be 
compatible with the `translate` of `Rect`?  Of course it 
should have the same number of arguments.  In addition, the 
arguments and return value should be compatible.  An argument 
in the overriding method is compatible if it accepts everything
that the inherited method accepts, so it should be 
equal or a supertype of the argument type of the inherited 
method.  The result type should be what we would expect 
from the inherited method, so it should be equal or a 
subtype of the return type of the inherited method.

## Abstract classes

So far we have used inheritance as a way to avoid 
repetitive code by reusing (inheriting) methods 
in subclasses.  Considering the Liskov substitution 
principle and the way subclasses are treated as 
subtypes, you might wonder whether sometimes it 
might be useful to create a superclass and a set 
of subclasses even though there is little or nothing
to inherit.  Our purpose might be the subtype relation, 
knowing (and documenting) that any of the subtypes can 
be used where the supertype is expected. 
This is not only possible but common. 

So far we have a simple class `Rect` and a subclass 
`Square`, and although we overrode many of the 
`Rect` methods in `Square`, 
at least one method (`area`) is inherited.  Suppose 
now we also want a class `Triangle`.  A triangle is not
defined by two corners, and its area is not computed 
in the same way as the area of a `Rect`.  And yet 
we can write an `area` method, with a completely different 
implementation, that is called in the same way and 
has the same meaning.  It is easy to imagine a loop 
that sums up the area of a mixed lists of triangles and 
rectangles.   It is useful for a class 
 `Triangle` and class `Rect` to be subclasses of a 
single superclass `Shape`, even though there may be 
nothing that `Triangle` and `Rect` can inherit. 
 
 What would this class `Shape` look like?  What could 
we do with an object of class `Shape`, if it makes 
sense at all to create `Shape` objects?  In fact, even 
though we want the *class* `Shape` to describe 
what 
`Rect`s and `Triangle`s have in common, we probably 
don't want to even make it possible to create a 
`Shape` object directly;  all `Shape` objects should 
be `Rect`s (including `Square`s) or `Triangle`s. 

A class like `Shape` that organizes a set of subclasses 
but which can never be instantiated to create objects 
by itself is called an *abstract base class*.  We 
might define shape as an abstract base class like this: 

```python
class Shape:
    """An abstract base class that encompasses different concrete
    classes with common behavior but different representations.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        """There are *no* objects of an abstract class.  It's a
        concept, not a set of concrete things.
        """
        raise NotImplementedError("Do not instantiate 'Shape'; it is abstract")

    # Abstract methods are mostly to define signatures
    # (headers) of methods for the concrete subclasses

    def area(self) -> Number:
        raise NotImplementedError(f"Class {self.__class__} didn't define 'Area'")

    def translate(self, delta: Point) -> "Shape":
        """New shape offset from this one by delta as movement vector"""
        raise NotImplementedError(f"Class {self.__class__} didn't define 'translate'")
```

Note that this class is booby-trapped to crash if we 
make the mistake of trying to create a `Shape` object
directly.  In addition, the methods `area` and `translate` 
are also not intended to be inherited.  If they are 
inherited (presumably because we forgot to define an 
overriding method in a subclass, or perhaps  because 
we misspelled it), they will crash with a diagnostic 
message! 

Now that we have the abstract base class `Shape`, we 
want to make `Rect` a subclass of it.  Since we're 
overriding all the methods, we can simply change 
the header of the class: 

```python
class Rect(Shape):
```

We will give a similar header to `Triangle`, and again 
override all the methods declared in `Shape`:

```python
class Triangle(Shape):
    """A triangle is defined by three points."""

    def __init__(self, p1: Point, p2: Point, p3: Point):
        self.p1 = p1
        self.p2 = p2
        self.p3 = p3

    def translate(self, delta: Point) -> "Triangle":
        return Triangle(self.p1 + delta, self.p2 + delta, self.p3 + delta)

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return f"Triangle({self.p1}, {self.p2}, {self.p3})"

    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return f"Triangle({repr(self.p1)}, {repr(self.p2)}, {repr(self.p3)})"

    def area(self) -> Number:
        """Area of triangle is (1/2) * base * height"""
        # To determine height, we drop a perpendicular from one point
        # to the opposite side, then measure it.  Any side will do;
        # we'll take p1 as the point and (p2,p3) as the side.
        ix, iy = normal_intersect(self.p2.x, self.p2.y,
                                  self.p3.x, self.p3.y,
                                  self.p1.x, self.p1.y)
        intercept = Point(ix, iy)
        base = self.p2.dist(self.p3)
        height = self.p1.dist(intercept)
        return 0.5 * base * height
```

The area calculation for a triangle is a bit more involved 
than the calculation for a rectangle, but fortunately 
it was easy to reuse code for dropping a perpendicular that 
I developed for a different project.  You can view the 
[complete code](../sample_code/shapes.py) if you are interested.


### Check your understanding

One of these relations is not like the others: 

* `Square` is a subclass of `Rect`
*  A `Square` is a kind of `Rect`
*  A `Rect` contains `Point`s


### Class Diagrams 

If we want to communicate the relation between 
the *superclass* `Rect` and *subclass* `Square`, 
there is a more-or-less standard diagrammatic 
notation called a *class diagram* that indicates
the relation with an arrow: 

![Class diagram: Square is a subclass of Rect](img/class_diagram_square.svg)

The arrow expresses the "is-a" relation (a square *is-a* rectangle). 
Sometimes it is also useful to express the "has-a" relation, 
for example showing that one or more `Point` objects are 
instance variables of a `Rect` object. 

![Class diagram with has-a: Rect has-a Point](img/class_diagram_square_point.svg)

A class diagram to express the relation 
among `Rect`, `Square`, and `Point` may 
not be very useful, as the structure is 
simple and apparent from the code.  
Diagrams may be useful when the relations 
are more complex, particularly when it becomes 
difficult to describe them precisely, 
concisely, and clearly in prose.  A diagram 
expressing showing relations among `Shape`, 
`Rect`, and `Square` is slightly more 
useful:

# Inheriting from built-ins 

All the built-in types of Python, like `str`
and `dict` and even `int`, are classes.  Just 
as we were able to extend or *inherit from* 
the class `Rect`, it is occasionally useful to 
inherit from one of the built-in classes.  

Suppose we want to build a class to represent lists 
of shapes.   One approach would be to *wrap* a list, 
i.e., keeping a list of `Shape` as an instance variable in 
the new class: 

```python
class ShapeList:
    """A collection of Shapes."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.elements = []

    def area(self) -> Number:
        total = 0
        for el in self.elements:
            total += el.area()
        return total

    def append(self, item: Rect):
        """Delegate to elements"""
        self.elements.append(item)

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        """Delegate to elements"""
        return str(self.elements)
```

This is ok as far as it goes ... it allows us to append 
`Shape` objects to the list, to print the list with the 
`str` function, and to get the total area of shapes in the 
list.  But then perhaps we want to use the `len` function 
to see how many shapes are on the list, so we'll need to
write a method to delegate `len`.  Next we might want to 
use the `in` operation to check whether a shape is in the list.
If we want *all* the methods of `list`, we will end up 
with a rather large class definition just to delegate each 
method to the corresponding method of `list`. 

Wrapping is fine if we want just a few methods of `list`, 
especially if we specifically do *not* want some of the 
`list` methods to be available for `ShapeList`.  But if we 
want all of them, it is simpler (and probably less error prone)
to just inherit them from `list`: 

```python
class ShapeList(list):
    """A collection of Shapes."""

    def area(self) -> Number:
        total = 0
        for el in self:
            total += el.area()
        return total
```

We only have to define the added method `area`; all the 
rest of the methods `list` can be inherited.  
Note especially that we were able to write `for el in self`, 
using the looping methods of the built-in `list` class. 
Now we can write: 

```python
li = ShapeList()
li.append(Rect(Point(3, 3), Point(5, 7)))  # 2x4 = 8
li.append(Square(Point(2, 2), 2))           # 2x2 = 4
li.append(Triangle(Point(0, 0), Point(0, 1), Point(2, 0)))  # Area 1
print(f"ShapeList {li}")
print(f"Combined area is {li.area()}, expecting 13")
```

and the output will be 

``` 
ShapeList [Rect(Point(3, 3), Point(5, 7)), Square(Point(2, 2), 2), Triangle(Point(0, 0), Point(0, 1), Point(2, 0))]
Combined area is 13.0, expecting 13
```

### Test your understanding

We might choose to extend a built-in class like 
`list` or `dict` because 

* We want to change the way all lists work
* We want a class with all the methods of the 
  built-in class, plus one or more added methods 
* Instance variables can't hold values from the 
  built-in classes
