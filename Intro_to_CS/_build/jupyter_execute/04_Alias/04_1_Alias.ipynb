    "# Aliasing on Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "We say something is *aliased* when it has more\n",
    "than one name.  Mark Twain is an *alias* of \n",
    "Samuel Clemens.  Banksy is an *alias* of someone,\n",
    "but at the time of this writing I don't know \n",
    "who.  In software, we interpret \"name\" in a \n",
    "broad way to mean any way of designating some \n",
    "object.  If `x` names the same object as \n",
    "`elements[3]`, then we say that object is \n",
    "*aliased* and that `x` and `elements[3]` are \n",
    "*aliases*. \n",
    "\n",
    "## When Aliasing Doesn't Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason for making *immutable* objects \n",
    "is so that we can alias those objects without \n",
    "worry.  This is why `str` objects in Python \n",
    "are immutable.   If `x` refers to a string \n",
    "object, I can set `y = x` without any worry \n",
    "about the consequence of aliasing the string, \n",
    "because there is nothing I can do to `x` \n",
    "that will affect `y`.  All the operations on \n",
    "strings, like `strip` and `split`, return \n",
    "new objects rather than changing the strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is at least one way that we can observe \n",
    "aliasing with immutable objects:  The \n",
    "comparison `x is y` checks whether `x` is \n",
    "an alias of `y`.  It can yield some surprises. \n",
    "For example, Python sometimes aliases \n",
    "`int` values that are equal, and sometimes \n",
    "doesn't: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "PyDev console: starting.\n",
    "Python 3.8.0 (v3.8.0:fa919fdf25,...)\n",
    ">>> w = 5\n",
    ">>> x = 5\n",
    ">>> w is x\n",
    "True\n",
    ">>> w = 1000\n",
    ">>> x = 1000\n",
    ">>> w is x\n",
    "False\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "As long as we use `==` instead of `is`, we need \n",
    "not be concerned about whether `int` values or \n",
    "`str` values are aliased.  When we define our \n",
    "own immutable classes, we aim for similar \n",
    "behavior:  The `==` (that is `__eq__`) operation\n",
    "should define what we mean by \"same\", and \n",
    "aliasing (`is`) should be irrelevant. \n",
    "\n",
    "## When Aliasing is a Mistake \n",
    "\n",
    "While immutable objects are often convenient, \n",
    "sometimes they are impractical.  For example, \n",
    "the `list` class in Python is mutable because \n",
    "the `append` operation would be too expensive \n",
    "if it returned a new `list` object; it is much \n",
    "more efficient to modify (*mutate*) an \n",
    "existing list object.  But this means we must \n",
    "be careful: \n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    ">>> m = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    ">>> k = m\n",
    ">>> k.append(4)\n",
    ">>> print(m)\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This behavior, in which the value designated \n",
    "by one alias of an object is changed by \n",
    "an operation through another alias of the \n",
    "object, may be fine or even useful, but it \n",
    "may also lead to bugs that are difficult to \n",
    "find and correct.  This is one reason that \n",
    "our coding style guidelines require us to \n",
    "make it very clear and apparent when a \n",
    "method is a *mutator*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen examples where aliasing \n",
    "a mutable object is a mistake.  For example, \n",
    "if `Point` objects are mutable (if they have \n",
    "a `move` operation that changes a `Point` object, \n",
    "instead of returning a new `Point` object), then \n",
    "aliasing `Point` objects from different `Rect` \n",
    "rectangle objects is probably a mistake.  At the \n",
    "very least it requires great care to do it \n",
    "correctly, without unanticipated side effects. \n",
    "\n",
    "## When Aliasing is Helpful\n",
    "\n",
    "While unanticipated side effects can make \n",
    "aliasing a problem, occasionally we alias \n",
    "objects intentionally because we want to \n",
    "access the same objects in more than one way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose, for example, that we have a list of \n",
    "complex objects storing information about \n",
    "students.  Each object representing a student\n",
    "might include a given name, a family name, \n",
    "and a student identification number, among \n",
    "other pieces of information like favorite ice\n",
    "cream flavor.  We might want to find\n",
    "student records quickly using binary search\n",
    "for given name, family name, or student number. \n",
    "But binary search only works if the objects \n",
    "are in sorted order, and each of these \n",
    "search keys requires a different order!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Database systems have a simple solution\n",
    "to the problem of searching for the same \n",
    "objects by multiple keys:  They keep multiple \n",
    "*indexes* with aliased references to the \n",
    "records.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Multiple indexes to student records](img_04_1/indexes.*)\n",
    "\n",
    "While search structures are the most common \n",
    "intentional use of aliasing, it is also \n",
    "useful sometimes for refactoring program logic.\n",
    " \n",
    "Consider the simple game known as \n",
    "*noughts and crosses*\n",
    "or [*tic tac toe*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).\n",
    "Suppose the game board is represented by a \n",
    "list of lists of `Tile` objects, using letters \n",

    "desired order each time we needed them.  Python\n",
    "also provides *generators*, which are identical\n",
    "to functions except they may return several \n",
    "results, one at a time.  (The `range` \n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is more than one way of designating\n",
    "(\"naming\") the same object, we say the object \n",
    "is \"aliased\".   Aliasing immutable objects usually\n",
    "has no observable effect, and often \n",
    "we design objects to be immutable so that we \n",
    "can alias them freely.  We must be careful when \n",
    "aliasing mutable objects, because a change to \n",
    "the object through one \"name\" will be observable\n",
    "as a change to the object through any other \n",
    "\"names\" it may have. \n",
    "\n",
    "While aliasing can dangerous, it can also be useful. \n",
    "Sometimes we need different ways to designate \n",
    "the same set of objects, as when we traverse a \n",
    "collection repeatedly in different orders. And \n",
    "sometimes making a change to an object accessed \n",
    "through one name visible when the same object is\n",
    "accessed through other names is exactly what we \n",
    "want.  We illustrated this by accumulating the \n",
    "\"worth\" of game tiles accessed in different \n",
    "orders. \n",
