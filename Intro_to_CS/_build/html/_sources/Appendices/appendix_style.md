title: Style Guide for Python Programs
---

Most software development organizations have coding guidelines that
constitute a _house style_. These may be based on some more widely used
standard, but often they will also incorporate norms and preferences
developed by a particular organization. Students who took CIS 210 at UO
have used a style guide for that course, based on
[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and extended with
some additional rules suited to an introductory course.

Guidelines for CIS 211 projects are also based on
[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), but they differ in
some ways from those used in CIS 210. The key differences are that CIS
211 style is designed to be more concise.

#### Living Document

This document represents my best effort at defining style guidelines for
CIS 211, but like many software documents it requires regular revision.
We may find that we need some additional rules, or that some existing
rules are annoyingly strict, or that something is not as clear as it
should be. Also I make mistakes. Students are encouraged to suggest
revisions. Meanwhile, the standard for any particular project is the
version of this document as of the project due date. If the guidelines
change between distribution of a project and its due date, I will use
Piazza to announce whether the change applies to the current project,
and to the extent possible I will avoid making you revise projects that
have already been started.

## Basics: When in doubt, follow PEP 8

[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
is a widely used standard for Python code. It provides guidelines for
all variety of matters from indentation to spacing in expressions.

Note in particular that we will follow PEP8 naming conventions,
including `lower_case` for variables, functions, and methods,
`CamelCase` for classes, and `SHOUTS` for global constants.

PEP 8 recommends a maximum line length of 79 characters.  
This matters!  The human eye has limited accuracy as it moves from the
end of one line of text to the beginning of the next line. 79 is not a
magic number (accuracy depends on many other factors, such as vertical
space between lines), but under typical circumstances it is
approximately the length at which readers begin to have trouble finding
the beginning of the correct next line.

PEP 8 refers to
[PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) for docstring
conventions. We will also follow PEP 257 conventions. We will _not_
specify function and method type signatures in docstrings (see below for
the alternative), but when appropriate we may use docstring comments to
say more about arguments and return values.

## Function and method headers

We will use Python
[type annotations](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/)
(also known as _type hints_) to specify the signature (argument and
return types) of functions and methods. Type annotations are a
relatively new feature of Python, but they are supported well by
PyCharm.

Type annotations make it possible to specify the
_signature_ of a function very compactly, compared to describing
argument types in a docstring. Instead of this:

```python
def frobnaz(n, s):
    """frob the naz.
    :n:  integer, frob it this many times
    :s:  string from which we extract the naz
    :returns: string in which the naz has been frobbed
    """
```

we will write

```python
def frobnaz(n: int, s: str) -> str:
    """returns copy s with its frob nazzed n times"""
```

An absent return type is equivalent to specifying that the function or
method returns `None`.

Method headers follow the same rules as function signatures  `self`
argument, as it is implied by the class.

```python
class Point:
  """An (x,y) coordinate pair of integers"""

  def __init__(self, x: int, y: int):
    self.x = x
    self.y = y

  def move_to(self, new_x: int, new_y: int):
    """Change the coordinates of this Point"""
    self.x = new_x
    self.y = new_y
```

As with functions, the return type annotation `-> None` may be omitted
for methods that do not return a value. Such methods will generally be *
mutators*, i.e., it may be assumed that they modify the value of
the `self` object, like the
`move_to` method above.

### Mutation

Methods that return a value other than `None` (and which therefore have
the `-> T`
annotation for some type `T`) should typically *not* modify the value of
the `self` object.

For example, if I write this function header:

```python
def jazziest(musicians: List[Musician]) -> Musician:
```

it is implicit that the input list of musicians is not modified.

On rare occasions, concise and efficient code may require a method to
both return a  
value *and* modify the `self` object. The
`pop` method for lists is an example of a mutator method that returns a
result. This is permissible but must be clearly and explicitly
documented in the header function, and to the extent possible the
function name should suggest that it modifies its input.

For example, if the above function returned the jazziest musician an
also removed it from the list, the function header and docstring might
look like this:

```python
def pull_jazziest(musicians: List[Musician]) -> Musician:
    """Remove and return jazziest musician from musicians"""
```

### Forward type annotations

The second case in which we cannot simply write the type of an argument
or return value is when that type is the class we are defining.  
The type is considered undefined until the class is complete.  
Thus we cannot write

```python
    def __add__(self, other: Point) -> Point:
      """(x,y) + (dx, dy) = (x+dx, y+dy)"""
      return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)
```

because the `Point` class does not exist yet. The workaround is to place
quotes around the type name to indicate that it is a *forward reference*
, i.e., a reference to a type that we promise will exist soon even
though it does not exist quite yet.

```python
    def __add__(self, other: "Point") -> "Point":
      """(x,y) + (dx, dy) = (x+dx, y+dy)"""
      return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)
```

### Composite type annotations

Types like `int` and `str` can be used directly in type annotations.
Types like `tuple` and `list` can also be used in type annotations, but
typically we will prefer to be more specific, e.g., not just a `tuple`
but more precisely
*tuple in which the first element is a string and the second element is
an int*. We can make this more specific annotation by importing type
constructors from the `typing` module:

```python
from typing import Tuple, List, Dict


def i_eat_tuples(t: Tuple[str, int]) -> Tuple[int, Tuple[int, int]]:
    the_string, the_int = t
    return (the_int, (the_int, the_int))


def to_dict(ls: List[Tuple[str, int]]) -> Dict[str, int]:
    result = {}
    for key, value in ls:
      result[key] = value
    return result
```

### Docstrings for functions and methods

A docstring should provide information that is *useful to a developer*.
In particular, consider a developer who is building a new module that
uses the functions or classes in your module, or who has been asked to
add a feature to the code, fix a bug, or modify some functionality.
Avoid noisy repetition of information that is already present in type
hints, as well as information that is implicit. For example, the
developer does not need to be reminded that `__init__` is the
constructor, but may benefit from explanation of the data
representation.

Some methods may not require docstrings at all when they follow Python
conventions:

* An `__init__` that simply copies its arguments into instance variables
  according to a systematic naming scheme (e.g., argument `x` might be
  copied into `self.x` or `self._x`) may not require a docstring.

* An `__eq__` that checks for equality of some or all of its instance
  variables, with or without a type equivalence check
  (`type(self) == type(other)`) may not require a docstring, or the
  docstring may briefly summarize which instance variables are
  considered in the equivalence check.

* A single line `__str__` or `__repr__` may not require a docstring, but
  often it will be useful to document them with an example, particularly
  when the `__repr__` does not look exactly like a call to the
  constructor.


## Classes: Public and quasi-private attributes

In accordance with PEP 8, object fields and methods that are meant to be
public (that is, accessed from code outside the class or its subclasses)
should begin with a lowercase letter. Names of fields and methods that
are _not_ meant to be accessed directly by code outside a class should
begin with a single underscore. (These fields and methods might be
declared _private_ in a language with encapsulation, such as Java or
C++, but Python does not provide encapsulation.)

In addition to the access categories described in PEP 8, we add two that
can only be specified in docstrings:

* A docstring may describe a class as immutable (read-only), in which
  case its public fields may be accessed but not modified by code
  outside the class.

* In a class that is not immutable, individual fields may be described
  as read-only, meaning that outside code may access them but must not
  directly change them.

## Avoid _type_ and _isinstance_

CIS 211 is a course in _object-oriented_ programming. It emphasizes
making use of _dynamic dispatch_. Students who are not yet comfortable
with dynamic dispatch (method calls that may have different behavior
depending on the class of the object on which they are called) often use
the built-in functions _isinstance_ or _type_ to control behavior. Don't
do that. Assume that unless the instructions for a project or exam
question specifically allow
_isinstance_ or _type_, you should be using dynamic dispatch instead.
Inappropriate uses of _isinstance_
or _type_ will be marked as errors.

### Exception: _type_ comparison in `__eq__`

There is one blanket exception to the above rule about avoiding
`type`:  It is allowed and often a good idea to make an object
equivalence test (the `__eq__` magic method) include a type equality
check. For example, consider a simple `Point` class:

```python
class Point:
  """2D cartesian point"""

  def __init__(self, x: float, y: float):
    self.x = x
    self.y = y

  def __eq__(self, other: object) -> bool:
    return type(self) == type(other) and
    self.x == other.x and self.y == other.y
```

Note that if we create a subclass `Point3D` with a z coordinate, this
`__eq__` method will determine that `Point(5.0, 3.0, 7.0)` is not equal
to
`Point3D(5.0, 3.0)`; without the type check it would consider them
equal.

## Symbolic Constants vs Magic Values

A _magic number_ is a constant other than 0, 1, `True`, `False`, or
`""` or `[]` that appears literally in code. For example, this snippet
contains a magic number:

```python
area = radius * radius * 3.141592
```

For more explanation of magic numbers and why they are undesirable, see
the "Unnamed numerical constants" section of the
[Magic Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming))
article on
Wikipedia. I use the concept here to refer not only to numeric
constants, but also to strings that carry some special meaning in an
application.

Very occasionally, if a constant is used only once, and if its meaning
would be apparent to any developer reading the code, a magic constant
might be acceptable. In general, though, magic numbers should be
replaced by _symbolic constants_, e.g.,

```python
# Put this near the beginning of the file
PI = 3.141592
...
# Then use the symbolic name throughout
area = radius * radius * PI
```

When a group of constants represent alternatives, often
they are best represented by an _enumeration_.  Python supports
enumerations with the `enum` package.  The main advantage of 
enumerations over other symbolic constants is in providing a type
that can be declared in type annotations. 

```python
import enum

class Color(enum.Enum):
    RED = 1
    GREEN = 2
    BLUE = 3

light: Color  # Declare that variable light will only hold Color values
light = Color.red
```

If the same constant is used in more than one code file, and especially
if it is a value that could conceivably be changed, it should be
factored out into a separate source file. For example, if you are
constructing a board game with multiple source files, the size of the
game board probably belongs in a separate source file.



## Tests

We will not use doctests in CIS 211, and in most cases our docstrings
will not include examples of use. Instead, we will use unit tests
separate from the module code.

Unit tests may be included in the same source file as the code to be
tested, or it may be in a separate file. If it is in a separate file,
code to test `code.py` should be named
`test_code.py`.

We will use the Python
[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/unittest.html)
framework when practical. The _unittest_ framework may not be suitable
for testing some features, such as interactive input and output and
simulation results. In those cases, tests may be written using whatever
means is appropriate, with as much test automation as feasible.

In many cases I will provide a starter test suite with a project. The
provided test suite is _never_ exhaustive, and passing the provided test
cases is _not_ a guarantee that a project is correct. Students are
strongly encouraged to add their own test cases, and may sometimes be
required to do so (that is, designing and implementing good test cases
may be part of the project requirements).
