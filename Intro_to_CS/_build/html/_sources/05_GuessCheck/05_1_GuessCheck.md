title: Recursive Guess and Check 
---

While recursion in object-oriented programs is often coupled with 
recursive (tree-like) data structures, it is not the only 
pattern.  Another important recursive pattern is 
*recursive guess-and-check*, also called *search*.  This kind 
of recursive pattern is often used to search for a way to apply 
several sequential operations to reach a state that satisfies some 
properties. 

With recursive guess-and-check, we can imagine a sort of tree
in the *history* of states of the structure,  
but it never exists all at once.  Suppose we start with some 
initial structure, and we perform an 
operation intended to bring us closer 
to the desired state. The operation is 
just a guess ... we perform it without 
knowing for sure whether it is the 
right operation. 

![We make a guess](img_05_01/guess-check-1.svg)

Perhaps we determine that the new state 
is a dead end.  We discard it and try 
another move. 

![Try another move](img_05_01/guess-check-2.svg)

The rejected state is discarded; it no 
longer exists.  We only have the initial 
structure (or a way to recreate it) and 
the new structure based on a new guessed 
move.  

Perhaps this move looks promising, or 
at least we cannot determine that it 
is a dead end.  We make try another 
operation from it.  

![Guesses follow guesses](img_05_01/guess-check-3.svg)

If we keep doing this, following guesses 
by more guesses, or reverting to prior 
states when we reach a dead end, our guesses 
trace out a tree even though the only 
structures that we are really keeping 
are the path from the root to the 
current guess.   Eventually, if we 
have a systematic way of guessing all 
potentially useful moves and discarding 
dead ends, we find a sequence of moves 
to the desired solution.

## Elements of Recursive Guess-and-Check

To create a recursive guess-and-check 
function or method, we need: 

* (State) An initial state. This might be a 
chess position, or a Sudoku puzzle,
or a Tic Tac Toe board.  

* (Moves) A finite (preferably small) set of possible operations 
or moves that could potentially lead to a solution. 
If we are programming a chess game, these would be legal 
chess moves.  If we are programming a Sudoku solver, 
a 'move' would be choosing a value for some tile whose 
value has not been set. If we are programming an 
automated Tic-Tac-Toe player, a move would be placing a
mark (X or O, depending on side) in an empty place. 



* (Choose) A way of choosing the next move.  This could be a blind 
choice, or it could be based on some heuristic for choosing 
more promising moves.  In Sudoku we might favor finding a value
for a tile that has few possible values.  In chess the heuristic 
choice might be the main part of the program. Deep Blue, the first chess 
computer to beat a human world chess champion in 1997, had a heuristic evaluation 
function in 8000 parts 
([Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer\))). 
A simple heuristic function for choosing tic-tac-toe moves 
can be found in method `choose_for` in 
 the [sample code](../sample_code/tictac.py) 
from a prior chapter.  

* (Check) A way of determining whether a state is 
the solution we seek, or a hopeless dead end. 
A solution might be 
a victory in chess or tic-tac-toe, 
a complete and consistent grid in Sudoku.  (In two-player 
games like chess and tic-tac-toe, we can check for a 
'win' for either our own player or the opponent, and we 
may need to also recognize a draw.) 
If a Sudoku board is inconsistent 
(e.g., if it contains duplicate symbols in some row), 
then it is useless to continue; determining values 
of other tiles cannot fix it.  

* (Restore) A way of restoring a prior state.  Since we are 
only guessing at a good move, which might turn out
to be bad, we need a way of backing up and trying
something else.  Sometimes we can program an 
*undo* operation for each move, and keep just 
one complete state.  Often we need a way to 
save and restore states. 

## Basic guess-and-check search 

Given the elements above, the basic recursive 
guess-and-check search goes something like this: 

```
def guess-and-check(state) -> bool: 
    if the state is a solution: 
       return True
    if the state is a hopeless dead end: 
       return False

    save the current state
    for each possible next move: 
        make the move, giving new state
        if guess-and-check(new state): 
            return True
        else: 
            restore to saved state
    # We tried everything, and nothing worked
    return False
```

The are several possible variations on the 
basic procedure above. 

* We might not have to try all possible next
moves.  In Sudoku, for example, it suffices to 
try all possibilities for one tile, because 
possibilities for other tiles can be explored 
in the recursive calls. 

* In two-player games like chess and tic-tac-toe, 
we actually alternate between trying to find our 
own best move and trying to find the opponent's 
best move against us.  A win for us is a loss 
for the opponent, and vice versa. 

* In very complex games like chess, instead of 
exploring one sequence of moves at a time, we 
explore several concurrently, and typically we 
cannot search any single path all the way to 
a conclusion but only to a state that seems 
favorable (according to the same heuristic functions
we use to order our guesses). 

## An example: Magic Squares

A 
[magic square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square) 
is a grid in which each cell contains 
a distinct positive integer and each row, 
column, and diagonal sums to the same value. 

Let's suppose we wanted to find a magic 
square with 9 tiles in which each row, 
column, and diagonal summed to 15. 
 We might 
also keep a list of the values to be 
placed, so that they will be sure to be 
distinct if we place each value from the list. 

Given a state, the moves we can try are finding 
a place for one of the values.  Perhaps we 
start with 9. 

![Starting magic square](img_05_01/magic_square_mv1.svg)

We might try at first placing 9 in the corner. 
Then we make a recursive call to place the 
other tiles. 

In the recursive call, we would first check 
whether it is a solution (it is not) or a 
hopeless dead end. 
Our check for hopeless dead ends might rely 
on the observation that if any row, column, 
or diagonal already sums to a value greater than 
the desired target value 15, placing more tiles 
cannot fix it (because all our tile values are 
positive).   The board with a 9 in the corner 
is not hopeless according to this check, so 
we would go on and try to find a place 
for an 8.  We might first try placing it in the next 
available position. 

We make this move and make the recursive call. 
Again the recursive call first checks to see
whether the position is a solution or hopeless. 
It is hopeless, because 9+8 is already greater 
than the target value 15. 

![9 and 8 placed](img_05_01/magic_square_mv2.svg)

 This is a base case for the recursion:  We return
 to the prior state and try another move. 
 
 We restore the prior state (empty board 
 except for a 9 in the corner) and try another 
 position for the 8.  Again we make the 
 recursive call, and again it finds the state 
 hopeless. Return, restore, try another position, 
 until finally we find that the board would 
 not seem to be hopeless if we placed the 8 
 in a different row and column from the 9 and 
 off the diagonal. 
 
 ![Still hopeless](img_05_01/magic_square_mv3.svg)
 
 Since we judge this new position not hopeless, 
 we would make another recursive call to place the 
 seven, and so on.  Eventually *every* sequence of 
 moves that starts with placing 9 in the corner 
 will lead to failure.  The recursion will 
 return `False` all the way up to the first 
 place where we chose a position for the 9, 
 and start again to place the 8, the 7, and so on.
 
 ![Back to the beginning](img_05_01/magic_square_mvx.svg)

 In this way we will eventually find a sequence 
 of moves that leads to a solution. 
 
## Guess-and-Check for Sudoku

The basic recursive guess-and-check for Sudoku can 
work essentially like the magic square finder.  The 
essential elements for Sudoku are: 

* (State) The initial state is the Sudoku puzzle as we 
found it. 

* (Moves) The possible moves are candidate values for one 
tile. If we perform constraint propagation with the 
*naked single* and *hidden single* tactics as much 
as possible before resorting to guessing, we can 
select a tile with just a few candidate values. 


* (Choose) The next move is simply to try one of the candidate values
on the selected tile.  If the recursive call to solve the puzzle
fails, we try the next, and so on.  We only have to try 
values that are candidates for the tile, and we can focus 
on just the one tile and let the recursive calls take care 
of others. 

*  (Check) To determine whether a new position is a solution or hopeless, 
we will check whether it is consistent (no duplicate tiles in any 
row, column, or block) and whether it is complete (no unknown tiles). 
In principle this is enough, but solving a puzzle might be slow. 
To speed it up, we will perform the constraint propagation of 
*naked single* and *hidden single* as far as possible before 
checking. We must be a little careful, though, because our previous 
assumption that every puzzle we are presented is solvable is no 
longer valid:  Now we are trying puzzles with guesses, and some of the 
guesses are wrong! 

* (Restore) Because we are performing constraint propagation between guesses, 
we can't restore the prior state just by changing the value of 
one tile.  We will need to save the state of the Sudoku board 
before we begin making guesses about a tile value, and restore 
it to that prior value each time the recursive call returns `False`.
Since copying a whole board (without aliasing!) could be challenging, 
we could choose to save instead a representation like a list 
of strings from which the board can be restored.  We don't have to 
save *everything* about it as long as the missing information is 
easily restored.
