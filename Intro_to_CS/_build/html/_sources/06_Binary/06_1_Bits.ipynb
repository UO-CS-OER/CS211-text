    "# Bit Twiddling\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have undoubtedly heard, the data and instructions\n",
    "  manipulated by a modern digital computer are all in the\n",
    "  form of binary numbers.  Often we think of them in \n",
    "  other ways:  As characters, as strings, as (decimal) integers, as \n",
    "  (decimal) floating point numbers, as whatever we choose \n",
    "  to represent.  Programming languages like Python help us\n",
    "  mostly ignore that they are all really just binary numbers, \n",
    "  and usually that is a good thing, but sometimes it is useful \n",
    "   to peek under the covers and deal with the \n",
    "  binary representation more directly. \n",
    "  \n",
    "In this chapter we will manipulate binary numbers that \n",
    "may have multiple _fields_ that may be packed together \n",
    "into a single integer _word_.  We will look at how to \n",
    "_pack_ small binary numbers into _fields_ of a larger \n",
    "binary number, and how to extract the small integers \n",
    "from the packed representation.  Python provides several \n",
    "_bitwise_ operations to make this relatively simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "## It's already binary\n",
    "\n",
    "What's already binary?  Everything.  Everything in the computer is already \n",
    "binary. We will _not_ convert anything to binary.  If it is in computer \n",
    "memory, it is already binary, because that is the _only_ kind of information \n",
    "that modern computer memory can hold.  No exceptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may be under the impression that you have converted integers to binary \n",
    "form in the past.  In fact, Python has a built-in function called \n",
    "`bin`, and you may be under the impression that `bin` converts a number to \n",
    "binary: \n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    ">>> x = 42\n",
    ">>> bin(x)\n",
    "'0b101010'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been tricked!  The `bin` function does not convert the integer to binary. \n",
    "Let's see what the type of the result for the `bin` function really is: \n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    ">>> y = bin(x)\n",
    ">>> type(y)\n",
    "<class 'str'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `bin` function produces a string.  The string is a representation of how \n",
    "we might write the binary number ... but the number was already binary. \n",
    "\n",
    "But isn't that string also represented in binary?   OK, you've got me there ... \n",
    "all strings are also represented in binary, so in that sense $$101010_2$$ (which we \n",
    "write in Python as `0b101010`) is \n",
    "binary, but no more so than `\"Hello World\"`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### So when and how was it converted to binary? \n",
    "\n",
    "When any kind of data, including your program source code, is read by the computer, \n",
    "it is converted to binary as part of the reading process.  When you strike the 'k' \n",
    "key on the keyboard, a binary code for the letter 'k' is transmitted to the computer. \n",
    "When you type the keys '4' and '2',  you are producing the binary codes for the \n",
    "character '4' and the character '2'.  If you typed `x = 42` in your Python program, \n",
    "the Python compiler converted those character codes to the internal representation \n",
    "$$101010_2$$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### But when I print it, I see '42'\n",
    "\n",
    "When you print x, the internal representation 0b101010 is converted into the \n",
    "character codes for '4' and '2'.  At no time was the decimal integer 42 \n",
    "ever present.  It's a pleasant illusion brought to you by Python.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The same output conversion takes place regardless of how the \n",
    "integer was initially written.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> 0b101\n",
    "5\n",
    ">>> x = 0b101010\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "42\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "## The binary representation of an integer\n",
    "\n",
    "Although _everything_ is represented in binary, in this chapter we will deal only with \n",
    "integers, because their representation in binary is simplest.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When we write a decimal number on paper, we use a place value system:  The \n",
    "digits '42' mean $$4\\times{10^1} + 2\\times{10^0}$$, and the digits '203' mean \n",
    "$$2\\times{10^2} + 0\\times{10^1} + 3\\times{10^0}$$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Positive binary numbers are no different, except that the place value system \n",
    "uses powers of 2 instead of powers of 10.  The binary number $$101010_2$$\n",
    "means \n",
    "$$1\\times 2^5 + 0\\times 2^4 + 1\\times 2^3 + 0\\times 2^2  +\n",
    "1\\times 2^1 + 0\\times 2^0$$, or 32+8+2 = 42. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Treating bits as booleans\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we're used to using the binary values for ordinary\n",
    "  arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.), we can also\n",
    "  treat the individual binary digits as boolean values: 1 for True, 0\n",
    "  for False.  The  boolean operations on the bits act exactly like\n",
    "  their counterparts for truth values:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Each binary digit can be treated as a boolean value](img_06_01/bitops.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  We can extend the boolean\n",
    "  operations on bits to integers <em>bitwise</em> by just applying the\n",
    "  same boolean operation to each pair of bits. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Bitwise operations on memory words](img_06_01/bitwise.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> 0b1010100 & 0b10010110\n",
    "20\n",
    ">>> bin(0b1010100 & 0b10010110)\n",
    "'0b10100'\n",
    ">>> bin(0b1010100 | 0b10010110)\n",
    "'0b11010110'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that here I'm just using the `bin` function print a string\n",
    "representation of the binary number.  Internally the value \n",
    "of the result was always binary.  \n",
    " \n",
    " We can perform exactly the same bitwise operations \n",
    " when we enter integers in decimal notation: \n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    ">>> 3 & 5\n",
    "1\n",
    ">>> 3 | 5\n",
    "7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check your understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going on, make sure you understand why `3 & 5 == 1` and `3 | 5 == 7`.  \n",
    "Then predict the value of `3 & 4`, and check it in the Python console. \n",
    "Also predict and then check the value of `3 | 4`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When I write `3 & 5`, you can be sure I mean $$3_{10}$$ & $$5_{10}$$, not \n",
    "only because I didn't use the `0b` prefix to indicate a binary \n",
    "number, but also because $$3_2$$ & $$5_2$$ doesn't even make sense. \n",
    "Why wouldn't that make sense?  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Shifting\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to ordinary arithmetic (addition, subtraction, etc.) and \n",
    "bitwise operations (_and_, _or_, _not_), digital computers provide _shift_ \n",
    "operations that move binary digits within a memory word.  These \n",
    "are written in Python as `<<` (shift left) and `>>` (shift right). \n",
    "For example, `3 << 2` means that the value $$3_{10}$$, which is \n",
    "$$11_{2}$$, should be shifted left 2 places, with zeros filling\n",
    "in for the last two digits. \n",
    "\n",
    "![3 << 2](img_06_01/shift_left.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> 3 << 2\n",
    "12\n",
    ">>> bin(12)\n",
    "'0b1100'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we shift right with `>>`, some bits may be \"shifted off\" into the\n",
    "\"bit bucket\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "![7 >> 2](img_06_01/shift_right.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"bit bucket\" is not a physical thing.  It is a term programmers use \n",
    "to indicate that those bits have been discarded. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python: \n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    ">>> 7 >> 2\n",
    "1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Masking\n",
    "\n",
    "You might well wonder what use shifting could be.  It becomes more useful \n",
    "when we combine it with the bitwise boolean operations _and_ (&) and _or_ ( | ). \n",
    "\n",
    "For what follows, and whenever we refer to the positions of bits, we will \n",
    "number each bit according to the power of 2 it represents.  Thus the low-order \n",
    "bit is bit 0 (representing $$2^0$$, or $$1$$), and bit 3 represents $$2^3$$, or $$8$$).\n",
    "A single _byte_ of memory is 8 bits, numbered from 0 to 7: \n",
    "\n",
    "![Bit numbering](img_06_01/bit-numbering.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we wanted to extract just the value of bits 4..6. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Bits 4-6](img_06_01/bits-4-6.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can discard all the _other_ bits by constructing a *mask*, \n",
    "a value with 1 in bits 4..6 and 0 in all the other bits.  We \n",
    "*mask* the value using the bitwise _and_ operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Masking field 4..6](img_06_01/mask.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Masking selects just the bits we are interested in, setting all \n",
    "the other bits to zero, but they are still bit numbers 4..6. \n",
    "If we want to treat them as if those bits were the entire \n",
    "number, we can then shift them from bits 4..6 to bits 0..2. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Masking and shifting field 4..6 into 0..2](img_06_01/mask-shift.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python: \n",
    "\n",

    ">>> original = 0b01010011\n",

    "## Packing\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we had two natural numbers between 0 and 15, inclusive. \n",
    "Since $$15_{10}$$ is $$1111_2$$, each of these numbers \n",
    "can be represented with 4 binary digits.  Suppose we wanted \n",
    "to store them together, \"packed\" into a single 8-bit word. \n",
    "We can do this by shifting one of them into bits 4..7, leaving \n",
    "the other in bits 0..3, and combining them with \"or\". \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def pack_4_4(x: int, y: int) -> int:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Pack two 4-bit values into an\n",
    "    8-bit value.\n",

    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    assert 0 <= x <= 15\n",
    "    assert 0 <= y <= 15\n",
    "    return (x << 4) | y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can reverse this process, extracting the two 4-bit values \n",
    "by masking and shifting: \n",

    "    \"\"\"Unpack an 8 bit value into two 4-bit values,\n",
    "    treating bits 0..3 and 4..7 as non-negative\n",
    "    integers, returned as a tuple.\n",

    "    return (x, y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is relatively rare to pack values this way in Python. Python \n",
    "is a language designed to be simple and and quick for the \n",
    "programmer, not super efficient for the computer.  When \n",
    "we really need the efficiency of packing numbers together, \n",
    "we would typically choose a programming language (like C or C++)\n",
    "that is designed with a higher priority on efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is very common, on the other hand, to pack values this way in \n",
    "low level representations of data and code.  In particular, \n",
    "the instructions interpreted by a computer central processing unit\n",
    "(CPU), such as an Arm or Intel processor, are always composed \n",
    "of several different fields packed into a memory word.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: RGB color codes\n",
    "\n",
    "Another place where you may have encountered values packed in \n",
    "this manner is the red-green-blue (RGB) color values used \n",
    "in web pages.  Such a color is encoded as a 24-bit number, \n",
    "made up of an 8-bit value (that is, between 0 and 255) for \n",
    "its red component, an 8-bit value for its green component, and\n",
    "an 8-bit value for its blue component.  Typically you will \n",
    "see these expressed in base 16, known as hexadecimal. \n",
    "The hexadecimal value \n",
    "$$\\textrm{ff}00\\textrm{ff}_{16}$$,\n",
    "written as `#ff00ff` in HTML or CSS and written \n",
    "`0xff00ff` in Python, for example, can also be \n",
    "described in CSS as `rgb(255,0,255)`. \n",
    " It is a bright purple  with \n",
    "maximum values of red and blue ($$255_{10}$$ or \n",
    "$$\\textrm{ff}_{16}$$) \n",
    "and no green component ($$00_{16}$$). \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything in computer memory is encoded in binary. Although we \n",
    "typically write Python programs using decimal number notation, \n",
    "they are translated into binary when the program is read, \n",
    "and are never represented in decimal.  We don't have to convert \n",
    "values to binary.  They are already binary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each binary digit (bit) in an integer represents a value \n",
    "using a place value system that is just like our standard \n",
    "decimal system, except with powers of 2 instead of powers of 10. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also think of each binary digit as representing a truth \n",
    "value:  0 for False, or 1 for True.  The bitwise logical operations\n",
    "of Python treat the digits this way.  `x | y` takes the logical 'or'\n",
    "of each bit in `x` with the corresponding bit in `y`.  `x & y` takes \n",
    "the logical 'and' of each bit in `x` with the corresponding \n",
    "bit in `y`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also \"shift\" bits with `<<` (shift left) and `>>` (shift right). \n",
    "Using bitwise logical operations in combination with \n",
    "shifting, we can pack multiple small binary numbers into \n",
    "one integer, and unpack them again. \n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter has dealt only with positive binary numbers and zero. \n",
    "Negative numbers will be treated in a separate chapter. \n",
