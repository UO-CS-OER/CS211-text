As you have undoubtably heard, the data and instructions
  manipulated by a modern digital computer are all in the
  form of binary numbers.  Often we think of them in 
  other ways:  As characters, as strings, as (decimal) integers, as 
  (decimal) floating point numbers, as whatever we choose 
  to represent.  Programming languages like Python help us
  mostly ignore that they are all really just binary numbers, 
  and usually that is a good thing, but sometimes it is useful 
   to peek under the covers and deal with the 
  binary representation more directly. 
  
In this chapter we will manipulate binary numbers that 
may have multiple _fields_ that may be packed together 
into a single integer _word_.  We will look at how to 
_pack_ small binary numbers into _fields_ of a larger 
binary number, and how to extract the small integers 
from the packed representation.  Python provides several 
_bitwise_ operations to make this relatively simple. 

## It's already binary

What's already binary?  Everything.  Everything in the computer is already 
binary. We will _not_ convert anything to binary.  If it is in computer 
memory, it is already binary, because that is the _only_ kind of information 
that modern computer memory can hold.  No exceptions. 

You may be under the impression that you have converted integers to binary 
form in the past.  In fact, Python has a built-in function called 
`bin`, and you may be under the impression that `bin` converts a number to 
binary: 

``` 
>>> x = 42
>>> bin(x)
'0b101010'
```

You have been tricked!  The `bin` function does not convert the integer to binary. 
Let's see what the type of the result for the `bin` function really is: 

``` 
>>> y = bin(x)
>>> type(y)
<class 'str'>
```

The `bin` function produces a string.  The string is a representation of how 
we might write the binary number ... but the number was already binary. 

But isn't that string also represented in binary?   OK, you've got me there ... 
all strings are also represented in binary, so in that sense $$101010_2$$ (which we 
write in Python as `0b101010`) is 
binary, but no more so than `"Hello World"`. 

### So when and how was it converted to binary? 

When any kind of data, including your program source code, is read by the computer, 
it is converted to binary as part of the reading process.  When you strike the 'k' 
key on the keyboard, a binary code for the letter 'k' is transmitted to the computer. 
When you type the keys '4' and '2',  you are producing the binary codes for the 
character '4' and the character '2'.  If you typed `x = 42` in your Python program, 
the Python compiler converted those character codes to the internal representation 
$$101010_2$$.  

### But when I print it, I see '42'

When you print x, the internal representation 0b101010 is converted into the 
character codes for '4' and '2'.  At no time was the decimal integer 42 
ever present.  It's a pleasant illusion brought to you by Python.  

The same output conversion takes place regardless of how the 
integer was initially written.  

```python
>>> 0b101
5
>>> x = 0b101010
print(x)
42
```

 
 
## The binary representation of an integer

Although _everything_ is represented in binary, in this chapter we will deal only with 
integers, because their representation in binary is simplest.  

When we write a decimal number on paper, we use a place value system:  The 
digits '42' mean $$4\times{10^1} + 2\times{10^0}$$, and the digits '203' mean 
$$2\times{10^2} + 0\times{10^1} + 3\times{10^0}$$. 

Positive binary numbers are no different, except that the place value system 
uses powers of 2 instead of powers of 10.  The binary number $$101010_2$$
means 
$$1\times 2^5 + 0\times 2^4 + 1\times 2^3 + 0\times 2^2  +
1\times 2^1 + 0\times 2^0$$, or 32+8+2 = 42. 

## Treating bits as booleans

Although we're used to using the binary values for ordinary
  arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.), we can also
  treat the individual binary digits as boolean values: 1 for True, 0
  for False.  The  boolean operations on the bits act exactly like
  their counterparts for truth values:


![Each binary digit can be treated as a boolean value](img_06_01/bitops.svg)


  We can extend the boolean
  operations on bits to integers <em>bitwise</em> by just applying the
  same boolean operation to each pair of bits. For example:


![Bitwise operations on memory words](img_06_01/bitwise.svg)

In Python:

```
>>> 0b1010100 & 0b10010110
20
>>> bin(0b1010100 & 0b10010110)
'0b10100'
>>> bin(0b1010100 | 0b10010110)
'0b11010110'
```


Note that here I'm just using the `bin` function print a string
representation of the binary number.  Internally the value 
of the result was always binary.  
 
 We can perform exactly the same bitwise operations 
 when we enter integers in decimal notation: 
 
 ```python
>>> 3 & 5
1
>>> 3 | 5
7
```

### Check your understanding

Before going on, make sure you understand why `3 & 5 == 1` and `3 | 5 == 7`.  
Then predict the value of `3 & 4`, and check it in the Python console. 
Also predict and then check the value of `3 | 4`.  

When I write `3 & 5`, you can be sure I mean $$3_{10}$$ & $$5_{10}$$, not 
only because I didn't use the `0b` prefix to indicate a binary 
number, but also because $$3_2$$ & $$5_2$$ doesn't even make sense. 
Why wouldn't that make sense?  

## Shifting

In addition to ordinary arithmetic (addition, subtraction, etc.) and 
bitwise operations (_and_, _or_, _not_), digital computers provide _shift_ 
operations that move binary digits within a memory word.  These 
are written in Python as `<<` (shift left) and `>>` (shift right). 
For example, `3 << 2` means that the value $$3_{10}$$, which is 
$$11_{2}$$, should be shifted left 2 places, with zeros filling
in for the last two digits. 

![3 << 2](img_06_01/shift_left.svg)

In Python: 

```
>>> 3 << 2
12
>>> bin(12)
'0b1100'
```

When we shift right with `>>`, some bits may be "shifted off" into the
"bit bucket".  

![7 >> 2](img_06_01/shift_right.svg)

The "bit bucket" is not a physical thing.  It is a term programmers use 
to indicate that those bits have been discarded. 

In Python: 

``` 
>>> 7 >> 2
1
```

## Masking

You might well wonder what use shifting could be.  It becomes more useful 
when we combine it with the bitwise boolean operations _and_ (&) and _or_ ( | ). 

For what follows, and whenever we refer to the positions of bits, we will 
number each bit according to the power of 2 it represents.  Thus the low-order 
bit is bit 0 (representing $$2^0$$, or $$1$$), and bit 3 represents $$2^3$$, or $$8$$).
A single _byte_ of memory is 8 bits, numbered from 0 to 7: 

![Bit numbering](img_06_01/bit-numbering.svg)

Suppose we wanted to extract just the value of bits 4..6. 

![Bits 4-6](img_06_01/bits-4-6.svg)

We can discard all the _other_ bits by constructing a *mask*, 
a value with 1 in bits 4..6 and 0 in all the other bits.  We 
*mask* the value using the bitwise _and_ operation. 

![Masking field 4..6](img_06_01/mask.svg)

Masking selects just the bits we are interested in, setting all 
the other bits to zero, but they are still bit numbers 4..6. 
If we want to treat them as if those bits were the entire 
number, we can then shift them from bits 4..6 to bits 0..2. 

![Masking and shifting field 4..6 into 0..2](img_06_01/mask-shift.svg)

In Python: 

``` 
>>> original = 0b01010011
>>> mask = 0b01110000
>>> extracted = (original & mask) >> 4
>>> bin(extracted)
'0b101'
>>> extracted
5
```

## Packing

Suppose we had two natural numbers between 0 and 15, inclusive. 
Since $$15_{10}$$ is $$1111_2$$, each of these numbers 
can be represented with 4 binary digits.  Suppose we wanted 
to store them together, "packed" into a single 8-bit word. 
We can do this by shifting one of them into bits 4..7, leaving 
the other in bits 0..3, and combining them with "or". 

```python
def pack_4_4(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """Pack two 4-bit values into an
    8-bit value.
    x and y must be in range 0..15 inclusive.
    Result is in range 0..255 inclusive.
    """
    assert 0 <= x <= 15
    assert 0 <= y <= 15
    return (x << 4) | y
```

We can reverse this process, extracting the two 4-bit values 
by masking and shifting: 

```python
def unpack_4_4(packed: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Unpack an 8 bit value into two 4-bit values,
    treating bits 0..3 and 4..7 as non-negative
    integers, returned as a tuple.
    """
    # Extract bits 0..3
    y = (0b1111) & packed
    # Extract bits 4..7
    x = ((0b11110000) & packed) >> 4
    return (x, y)
```



It is relatively rare to pack values this way in Python. Python 
is a language designed to be simple and and quick for the 
programmer, not super efficient for the computer.  When 
we really need the efficiency of packing numbers together, 
we would typically choose a programming language (like C or C++)
that is designed with a higher priority on efficiency. 

It is very common, on the other hand, to pack values this way in 
low level representations of data and code.  In particular, 
the instructions interpreted by a computer central processing unit
(CPU), such as an Arm or Intel processor, are always composed 
of several different fields packed into a memory word.  

## Example: RGB color codes

Another place where you may have encountered values packed in 
this manner is the red-green-blue (RGB) color values used 
in web pages.  Such a color is encoded as a 24-bit number, 
made up of an 8-bit value (that is, between 0 and 255) for 
its red component, an 8-bit value for its green component, and
an 8-bit value for its blue component.  Typically you will 
see these expressed in base 16, known as hexadecimal. 
The hexadecimal value 
$$\textrm{ff}00\textrm{ff}_{16}$$,
written as `#ff00ff` in HTML or CSS and written 
`0xff00ff` in Python, for example, can also be 
described in CSS as `rgb(255,0,255)`. 
 It is a bright purple  with 
maximum values of red and blue ($$255_{10}$$ or 
$$\textrm{ff}_{16}$$) 
and no green component ($$00_{16}$$). 

```python
def rgb_pack(r: int, g: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Pack the red, green, and blue values into an integer"""
    rgb = (r << 16) | (g << 8) | b
    return rgb

def rgb_unpack(rgb: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int]:
    """Unpack rgb color into r, g, b components"""
    b = rgb & 255
    rg = rgb >> 8
    g = rg & 255
    r = rg >> 8
    return (r, g, b)

purple = rgb_pack(255, 0, 255)
assert purple == 0xff00ff
r, g, b = rgb_unpack(purple)
assert r == 255 and g == 0 and b == 255
```

## Summary

Everything in computer memory is encoded in binary. Although we 
typically write Python programs using decimal number notation, 
they are translated into binary when the program is read, 
and are never represented in decimal.  We don't have to convert 
values to binary.  They are already binary. 

Each binary digit (bit) in an integer represents a value 
using a place value system that is just like our standard 
decimal system, except with powers of 2 instead of powers of 10. 

We can also think of each binary digit as representing a truth 
value:  0 for False, or 1 for True.  The bitwise logical operations
of Python treat the digits this way.  `x | y` takes the logical 'or'
of each bit in `x` with the corresponding bit in `y`.  `x & y` takes 
the logical 'and' of each bit in `x` with the corresponding 
bit in `y`. 

We can also "shift" bits with `<<` (shift left) and `>>` (shift right). 
Using bitwise logical operations in combination with 
shifting, we can pack multiple small binary numbers into 
one integer, and unpack them again. 

This chapter has dealt only with positive binary numbers and zero. 
Negative numbers will be treated in a separate chapter.
