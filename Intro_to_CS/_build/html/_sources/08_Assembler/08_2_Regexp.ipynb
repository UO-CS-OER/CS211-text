    "This code is in the Ruby language, but the \n",

    "\n",
    "In this chapter and in our project, I do not\n",

    "\n",
    "* I want you to be able to read very \n",
    "  basic regular expressions for text that \n",
    "  has a restricted, very predictable format. \n",
    "  \n",

    "  regular expressions that sometime in the \n",
    "  future, when you encounter a problem for \n",
    "  which more complex regular expressions are\n",

    "  open up one of the many, many tutorials or \n",
    "  reference guides available online and learn \n",
    "  what you need to solve your immediate problem. \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Patterns are Like Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are like a little \n",
    "programming language designed just for \n",
    "matching patterns in text.  In Python we \n",
    "write these little pattern programs as \n",
    "quoted strings which are interpreted by the \n",
    "`re` module. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic regular expression is a \n",
    "string to be matched.  For example, if we \n",
    "wanted to find the word `cat` in string `s`, \n",
    "we can write \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cat_pat = \"cat\"\n",
    "s = \"My cat's name is Nora\"\n",
    "m = re.search(cat_pat, s)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`re.search` will either return a _match object_ \n",
    "or `None`.  Since \"cat\" does appear in \n",
    "string `s`, \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if m:\n",
    "    print(f\"Matched {m.start()}..{m.end()}\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"*** No Match ***\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "will print `Matched 3..6`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While `re.search` looks for any occurrence of\n",
    "the pattern, `re.match` checks whether the \n",
    "whole string matches the pattern.  Thus \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "m = re.match(cat_pat, s)\n",
    "if m:\n",
    "    print(f\"Matched {m.start()}..{m.end()}\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"*** No Match ***\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "prints `*** No Match ***`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### White space and comments in regular expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, a space in a regular expression \n",
    "matches a space in a string. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "pat = \" is \"\n",
    "s = \"My cat's name is Nora\"\n",
    "m = re.search(pat, s)\n",
    "if m:\n",
    "    start, end = m.start(), m.end()\n",
    "    print(f\"Matched {start}..{end}\")\n",
    "    print(f\"Matched substring is '{s[start:end]}'\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"*** No Match ***\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "prints \n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    "Matched 13..17\n",
    "Matched substring is ' is '\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine if the only spaces permitted in a Python\n",
    "program were those required by Python syntax, \n",
    "and there was no way to include comments. \n",
    "Our Python programs would be nearly as \n",
    "unreadable as many regular expressions. \n",
    "The Python `re` module, however, gives us \n",
    "the option of adding white space, comments, \n",
    "and newlines.  Adding the `re.X` flag \n",
    "argument to `re.search` or `re.match` enables\n",
    "these readability aids: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pat = r\"\"\"\n",
    "c    # C is for cat\n",
    "a    # an a in the middle\n",
    "t    # This pattern really didn't need comments, but others do\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "s = \"My cat's name is Nora\"\n",
    "m = re.search(pat, s, re.X)     ## re.X allows commented patterns\n",
    "if m:\n",
    "    start, end = m.start(), m.end()\n",
    "    print(f\"Matched {start}..{end}\")\n",
    "    print(f\"Matched substring is '{s[start:end]}'\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"*** No Match ***\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Composing Patterns \n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions wouldn't be very \n",
    "powerful if we could only search for \n",
    "fixed strings.   Fortunately we can build up \n",
    "complex patterns with operators.  This why \n",
    "they are called \"expressions\"; we combine simple \n",
    "patterns into more complex expressions just as \n",
    "we combine simple arithmetic expressions into \n",
    "more complex expressions with arithmetic operators \n",
    "like `+` and `-`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Or (`|`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose _e1_ and _e2_ are regular expressions, \n",
    "and that they match _m1_ and _m2_, respectively.  \n",
    "We can write a pattern _e1_ \\| _e2_ to match \n",
    "either what _e1_ matches or what _e2_ matches, \n",
    "with parentheses to avoid ambiguity. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pat = \"(cat)|(dog)|(ferret)\"\n",
    "s = \"My cat's name is Nora\"\n",
    "m = re.search(pat, s, re.X)     ## re.X allows commented patterns\n",
    "if m:\n",
    "    start, end = m.start(), m.end()\n",
    "    print(f\"Matched {start}..{end}\")\n",
    "    print(f\"Matched substring is '{s[start:end]}'\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"*** No Match ***\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repetition (`*` and `+`)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write _e1_\\* to match any number of \n",
    "repetitions of what _e1_ matches, including \n",
    "zero, or we can write _e1_+ to match \n",
    "one or more repetitions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pat = \"(ch-)*(changes)\"\n",
    "bowie = \"Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes  # Turn and face the strange\"\n",
    "m = re.search(pat, bowie, re.X)     ## re.X allows commented patterns\n",
    "if m:\n",
    "    start, end = m.start(), m.end()\n",
    "    print(f\"Matched {start}..{end}\")\n",
    "    print(f\"Matched substring is '{bowie[start:end]}'\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Prints: \n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    "Matched 3..19\n",
    "Matched substring is 'ch-ch-ch-changes'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concatenation \n",
    "\n",
    "The examples above are actually using another \"operator\"\n",
    "for regular expressions.  The pattern `\"cat\"` is actually \n",
    "three patterns (`c`, `a`, and `t`) that are concatenated \n",
    "to form one longer pattern to match the concatenation of \n",
    "what each of the individual letter patterns matches.  \n",
    "A more interesting application of concatenation appears \n",
    "in `\"(ch-)*(changes)\"`.  Here `ch-` pattern may be \n",
    "repeated, but it must be followed by something that \n",
    "matches `changes`.  We have used parentheses to be \n",
    "clear that the whole string \"ch-\" must be repeated, and \n",
    "not just the hyphen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Character sets (`[]`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that `\"(ch-)*(changes)\"` did not match the \n",
    "beginning \"Ch\" of \"Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes\".  We could \n",
    "use `|` allow the \"c\" to be matched in lower case or \n",
    "capitalized: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pat = \"((c|C)h-)*(changes)\"\n",
    "bowie = \"Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes  # Turn and face the strange\"\n",
    "m = re.search(pat, bowie, re.X)     ## re.X allows commented patterns\n",
    "if m:\n",
    "    start, end = m.start(), m.end()\n",
    "    print(f\"Matched {start}..{end}\")\n",
    "    print(f\"Matched substring is '{bowie[start:end]}'\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Often it is simpler to give a set or range of characters. \n",
    "`[axe]` matches any of \"a\", \"x\", or \"e\".  `[c-f]` matches \n",
    "any of \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", or \"f\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pat = \"([Cc]h-)*([a-z]+)  # Turn and face the strange\"\n",
    "bowie = \"Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes \"\n",
    "m = re.search(pat, bowie, re.X)     ## re.X allows commented patterns\n",
    "if m:\n",
    "    start, end = m.start(), m.end()\n",
    "    print(f\"Matched {start}..{end}\")\n",
    "    print(f\"Matched substring is '{bowie[start:end]}'\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Prints \n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    "Matched 0..19\n",
    "Matched substring is 'Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wild card (`.`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The symbol `.` (pronounced \"dot\") is a wild card that matches \n",
    "any single character.  We can use `.*` to match a substring \n",
    "of any length (including length zero), containing \n",
    "anything.  The wild card is particularly useful for matching\n",
    "text between delimiters, but we must be careful because it is \n",
    "\"greedy\" and will prefer the longest possible match.  For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "m = re.search(pat, bowie, re.X)     ## re.X allows commented patterns\n",
    "if m:\n",
    "    start, end = m.start(), m.end()\n",
    "    print(f\"Matched {start}..{end}\")\n",
    "    print(f\"Matched substring is '{bowie[start:end]}'\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Prints: \n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    "Matched 2..12\n",
    "Matched substring is '-ch-ch-ch-'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Search, Match, and Fullmatch\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples above, we have used the `search` function from \n",
    "`re` to find a substring matching the pattern anywhere in the \n",
    "string.   That is often the right choice if we are searching \n",
    "in unstructured text, most of which we skip over.  When we process \n",
    "structured text (like a spreadsheet, or assembly language source code) \n",
    "or semi-structured text (like html or markdown documents), \n",
    "we may not want skip over everything that doesn't match \n",
    "the pattern.  If we want the matched substring to start at the \n",
    "beginning of the string, we can use `match` instead of `search`. \n",
    "If the whole string should match, we can use `fullmatch`. \n",
    "\n",
    "| `re` function  |  matches              |\n",
    "|----------------|-----------------------|\n",
    "| `re.search`    | pattern anywhere in string (ignore the rest) |\n",
    "| `re.match`     | pattern must match beginning of string |\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Capturing\n",
    "\n",
    "Often it is not enough to know the position of the whole match.  \n",
    "Particularly when we are using `re.fullmatch`, we typically want \n",
    "to know which parts of the pattern matched which parts of the string. \n",
    "These are called \"captures\".  Each parenthesized part of the \n",
    "pattern creates a \"capture group\", which can be extracted from \n",
    "the match object: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pat = \"((c|C)h-)*(changes)  # Turn and face the strange\"\n",

    "We can improve on this by giving the capture group names. \n",
    "We assign a name to a group by enclosing it in parentheses \n",
    "and prepending `?P<name>`. We can then obtain the named \n",

    "* You should be able to read a fairly simple regular expression\n",

    "  \n",
    "* You should understand _why_ we use regular expressions well \n",
    "  enough that in the future, when you are faced with a task \n",
