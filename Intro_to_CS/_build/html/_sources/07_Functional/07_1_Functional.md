title:  Sometimes Functions are Values
---

Our project for week 7 largely builds on 
concepts introduced earlier in the term,
especially bitfield packing and unpacking but 
also objects with other objects as fields 
(e.g., the ALU and registers are part of the CPU, 
and the 
Memory is attached ("wired") to the CPU in the 
main program), the Model-View-Controller pattern 
attaching a graphical display to the CPU and memory 
state, some careful sequential logic to 
update the program counter register at the right 
point in the execution cycle. 

One small part that may seem unfamiliar is the 
way the ALU executes operations by looking them 
up in a table.  We have actually seen similar 
techniques a couple times before: 

* In the Agenda project, we passed a function to the 
  built-in `sort` method to order appointments by 
  start time: 
  `self.elements.sort(key=lambda appt: appt.start)`
  
* In the Calculator project, we used a table of classes to avoid 
  repetitive code while parsing the postfix expressions: 
  `stack.append(BINOPS[tok.kind](left, right))`
  We called the classes in the 
  `BINOPS` and `UNOPS` tables to create 
  objects of the classes corresponding to each symbol like 
  `+` and `*`.  
  
In our simulation of the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) of the 
Duck Machine, we will use a table in which the keys are 
numeric operation codes and the values are functions indicated 
by those codes.  This is very analogous to the circuitry 
called a "multiplexer" that selects connections based on the 
values (1 or 0, positive voltage or no voltage) on some of its 
input wires. 

### When should we use functions as values? 

Some programming languages allow us to treat functions as 
values.  We can store functions in variables, pass functions to other 
functions, return functions from functions, etc.  When we can 
do this, we say that functions are _first class values_ in 
the programming language.  Python is such a language. 

In some other programming languages you will learn, functions may 
not be first class values.  Java, for example, has methods but 
not functions, and methods are not first class values (although 
recently a limited kind of first class function value, 
called a *lambda expression*, was added to Java).  
In C you will encounter 
_function pointers_, which are first class values, although they 
are a little trickier to define and 
use than function objects in Python.  Each language you learn may be 
a little different in terms of whether and how you can treat 
functions as values. 

We use functions as values for some of the same reasons we use 
classes and subclasses in object oriented languages:  To simplify 
and generalize code, avoiding redundancy by factoring out 
the parts that are repetitive. Classes and subclasses may be 
more useful in some situations, and functions as values may be 
more useful in others: 

* Classes and subclasses are especially useful when there is a 
  natural subtype hierarchy to organize variation, such as 
  organizing our calculator expression classes as binary and 
  unary operations.   The object-oriented style is also useful 
  when we maintain complex state, such as the fields of 
  appointment objects in our agenda project. 

* Functions as values are sometimes more useful than classes 
  when functions are natural building blocks, especially when 
  we don't have as much need to maintain complex state. 
  Functions also make good building blocks even if state is complex
  but more uniform than the functions we want to apply. 
  
Sometimes either approach would be about equally applicable.  
For example, in our calculator project, instead of creating 
several subclasses of the `BinOp` class, we could have created 
a single class with an instance variable holding the function 
to be applied.  The code would have been a little shorter, 
but whether it would have been simpler is arguable. 

## Functional Programming in Python 

Python supports both an object-oriented style of programming 
and a functional style of programming.  The object-oriented 
style is more common in large projects, but sometimes 
the functional style is just the tool we need to 
greatly simplify some code.  Two particularly useful 
tricks of the trade are storing functions in tables 
(dicts) and passing functions to functions or methods.

### Lambda is just shorthand

Often when you encounter functions as values, they are 
written as lambda expressions, e.g., `lambda x: x + 1`. 
There is nothing complex or mysterious about lambda.  It 
is just shorthand for the familiar function function 
definition, e.g., 
```python
def f(x): 
    return x + 1
```

The lambda expression doesn't have a name, but it is easy 
enough to give it one: 

```python
f = lambda x: x + 1
```

The two definitions of `f` above, with a conventional function definition
and with a lambda expression assigned to variable `f`, do 
precisely the same thing.  We simply use the lambda expression 
to avoid writing out the longer function definition, when 
it fits on one line, and especially 
when it doesn't need a name.  

### Beyond sum:  Reduce 

You may know that you can add up the elements of a list with the
`sum` function: 

```python
>>> sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
15
```

What if we wanted to instead multiply all the elements, 
or count them?   We can write a single function for all 
of these, passing in the function by which the elements 
are all combined to obtain a single summary value. 

```python
def reduce(l: List[int], initial: int, f: Callable[[int], int]) -> int:
    """ Reduce l by f, i.e., f(el, f(el, f(el, ...))) for el in l"""
    reduction = initial
    for el in l:
        reduction = f(reduction, el)
    return reduction
```

The type hints are unwieldy (and would have been even more 
unwieldy if I had written a version that works for all kinds 
of lists, not just lists of `int`), but the code is simple: 
It just keeps applying a function over and over to distill the 
list to a single value.   To get a sum, I pass in a function 
(which I can write compactly using`lambda`) to add elements: 

```python
li = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Reduce with + is same as sum
assert reduce(li, 0, lambda a,b: a+b) == 15
```

If instead I want the product of all the elements, 
I pass in a function that multiplies: 

```python
# Reduce with * is product of all elements
assert reduce(li, 1, lambda a,b: a*b) == 120
```

If I want to just count the elements, I can ignore the 
values and just add one at each step: 

```python
# Trickier!  We can also get a 'count' function
assert reduce(li, 0, lambda a,b: a+1) == 5
```

Of course I am not limited to short nameless functions 
written with lambda.  I can find a maximum or minimum 
if I a careful about what to use as an initial value: 

```python
# Max, min, or some other selection
def larger(x, y):
    """For demo purposes only; built-in max is preferable"""
    if x > y: return x
    return y

assert reduce(li, li[0], larger) == 5
```

### Walking a tree with a function value

The `reduce` function described above was intriguing, but 
not really very useful since Python already gives us many 
reductions on lists including `sum`, `max`, etc.  However, 
we can use the same basic technique with other data structures, 
where the built-in Python functions are not applicable.  
Let's consider a simple tree of integers with a `reduce`
method: 

```python
class Tree:
    """The abstract base class"""

    def reduce(self, f: Callable[[int, int], int],
               leaf_val: Optional[int] = None):
        """f is a function for combining values of subtrees.
        Leaves will return their own value unless leaf_val
        is specified.
        """
        raise NotImplementedError("Each subclass must implement reduce")

class Leaf(Tree):
    def __init__(self, val: int):
        self.val = val

    def reduce(self, f: Callable[[int, int], int],
               leaf_val: Optional[int] = None):
        if leaf_val is None:
            return self.val
        else:
            return leaf_val

class Inner(Tree):
    def __init__(self, left: Tree, right: Tree):
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

    def reduce(self, f: Callable[[int, int], int],
               leaf_val: Optional[int] = None):
        return f(self.left.reduce(f, leaf_val),
                 self.right.reduce(f, leaf_val))
```

We can use the `reduce` method with a function argument 
to implement different ways of summarizing values of the 
leaves, just as we did for a list: 

```python
t = Inner(Inner(Leaf(1), Leaf(2)),
          Inner(Leaf(3), Inner(Leaf(4), Leaf(5))))

# Sum leaves of tree
assert t.reduce(lambda v,w: v+w) == 15
# Product of leaves of tree
assert t.reduce(lambda v,w: v*w) == 120
# Max/Min leaf of tree using built-in max and min
assert t.reduce(max) == 5
assert t.reduce(min) == 1
# Count leaves
assert t.reduce(lambda x,y: x+y, leaf_val=1) == 5
```

### Use as needed; Don't get carried away

Function values are powerful, and sometimes they are just 
the right tool for the job.  Other times, you can accomplish 
the same thing with simpler approaches.  Many programmers 
find it difficult to read code that uses function values 
extensively.  

Functions or methods that take functions as arguments can be 
most useful when one such function can be used in place of 
several.  For example, if I only needed a method to sum 
the leaves of a tree, I would write a (recursive) `sum` method, 
and not a general `reduce` method.  But if I need `sum` and 
`product` and `max` and `min`, then a single `reduce` method 
becomes an attractive option.  

We have seen this in our prior projects that used function 
arguments and tables of functions or classes.  The table of 
classes in our calculator project replaced a chain of
redundant `elif` ... 
`elif` ... `elif` clauses in our parser, so it was worthwhile.
The table of operation functions in the ALU class for the 
Duck Machine simulator likewise allows us to avoid a chain 
of largely repetitive code.  
The `key=` function argument to `sort` saves us from more 
complex ways of controlling the sort function.  Using functions 
as values (in tables, and as arguments to methods or functions)
is worthwhile in these contexts.  

### There's more 

There is much more you can do with functions as values 
in Python.  For example, frameworks for web applications, like 
Django and Flask, create a table of functions for handling 
different URLs.  Both Django and Flask use Python _decorators_, 
which are functions that operate on other Python functions. 
Don't worry if that sounds confusing ... it's not something we're 
going to do in CIS 211.  But they are there for you sometime 
in the future when you need them. 

You can program for years in Python only occasionally encountering
functions as values, and maybe managing to use them without 
really understanding them.  In some other languages, functions as 
values play a much more central role.  If you write web application 
code that executes in the browser, you are likely to encounter 
JavaScript code that uses functions as values.  You may also 
encounter some programming languages, like ML or Haskell, that 
are called "functional languages" because functions that 
combine other functions are as central to them as classes and 
objects are to Python. 

## Summary

Sometimes using a function as a value, in a table or passed 
as an argument to another function, can greatly simplify your
code and remove redundancy.  Python is primarily an object-oriented 
language, not a functional language, and most of the time 
classes and objects give us the tools we need to solve problems. 
But sometimes a little bit of functional programming is a 
powerful addition.
