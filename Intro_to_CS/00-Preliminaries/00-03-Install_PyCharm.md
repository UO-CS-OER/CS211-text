#  Installing PyCharm

In [part one](https://uo-cs-oer.github.io/CS210-text) we
worked with IDLE, but simple development environment that
comes packaged with a standard Python installation.  In part
two we will make use of a more sophisticated
interactive development environment (IDE) to manage more
complex projects, and in particular to make use a more
sophisticated debugger.  

In the remainder of this section, and in subsequent chapters,
we will describe how to install and use
[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
(called VSCode for short) is another good choice, with similar
capabilities. You are 
welcome to install and use VSCode instead, but our instructions will 
assume PyCharm to avoid explaining everything twice.

## Obtain a license

PyCharm is provided in two versions, a free "community edition" and
a non-free "professional edition".  As a college or university student
(high school students and teachers too!)  you can obtain a free license 
for the professional edition
using this [student license application form](
https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students). 
You 
will need an official university email address or identification.  
The license application typically takes a few days.

You can download and install PyCharm and use it in the 30 day free trial
while waiting for your license. 

## Download PyCharm

You can download the appropriate version of PyCharm for your 
operating system (macOS, Windows, or Linux)
from [this download page](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).

Install PyCharm as you would other applications.
