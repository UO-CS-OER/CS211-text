title: Aliasing on Purpose 
---

We say something is *aliased* when it has more
than one name.  Mark Twain is an *alias* of 
Samuel Clemens.  Banksy is an *alias* of someone,
but at the time of this writing I don't know 
who.  In software, we interpret "name" in a 
broad way to mean any way of designating some 
object.  If `x` names the same object as 
`elements[3]`, then we say that object is 
*aliased* and that `x` and `elements[3]` are 
*aliases*. 

## When Aliasing Doesn't Matter

One reason for making *immutable* objects 
is so that we can alias those objects without 
worry.  This is why `str` objects in Python 
are immutable.   If `x` refers to a string 
object, I can set `y = x` without any worry 
about the consequence of aliasing the string, 
because there is nothing I can do to `x` 
that will affect `y`.  All the operations on 
strings, like `strip` and `split`, return 
new objects rather than changing the strings. 

There is at least one way that we can observe 
aliasing with immutable objects:  The 
comparison `x is y` checks whether `x` is 
an alias of `y`.  It can yield some surprises. 
For example, Python sometimes aliases 
`int` values that are equal, and sometimes 
doesn't: 

```
PyDev console: starting.
Python 3.8.0 (v3.8.0:fa919fdf25,...)
>>> w = 5
>>> x = 5
>>> w is x
True
>>> w = 1000
>>> x = 1000
>>> w is x
False
``` 

As long as we use `==` instead of `is`, we need 
not be concerned about whether `int` values or 
`str` values are aliased.  When we define our 
own immutable classes, we aim for similar 
behavior:  The `==` (that is `__eq__`) operation
should define what we mean by "same", and 
aliasing (`is`) should be irrelevant. 

## When Aliasing is a Mistake 

While immutable objects are often convenient, 
sometimes they are impractical.  For example, 
the `list` class in Python is mutable because 
the `append` operation would be too expensive 
if it returned a new `list` object; it is much 
more efficient to modify (*mutate*) an 
existing list object.  But this means we must 
be careful: 

``` 
>>> m = [1, 2, 3]
>>> k = m
>>> k.append(4)
>>> print(m)
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```
This behavior, in which the value designated 
by one alias of an object is changed by 
an operation through another alias of the 
object, may be fine or even useful, but it 
may also lead to bugs that are difficult to 
find and correct.  This is one reason that 
our coding style guidelines require us to 
make it very clear and apparent when a 
method is a *mutator*.  

We have already seen examples where aliasing 
a mutable object is a mistake.  For example, 
if `Point` objects are mutable (if they have 
a `move` operation that changes a `Point` object, 
instead of returning a new `Point` object), then 
aliasing `Point` objects from different `Rect` 
rectangle objects is probably a mistake.  At the 
very least it requires great care to do it 
correctly, without unanticipated side effects. 

## When Aliasing is Helpful

While unanticipated side effects can make 
aliasing a problem, occasionally we alias 
objects intentionally because we want to 
access the same objects in more than one way. 

Suppose, for example, that we have a list of 
complex objects storing information about 
students.  Each object representing a student
might include a given name, a family name, 
and a student identification number, among 
other pieces of information like favorite ice
cream flavor.  We might want to find
student records quickly using binary search
for given name, family name, or student number. 
But binary search only works if the objects 
are in sorted order, and each of these 
search keys requires a different order!  

Database systems have a simple solution
to the problem of searching for the same 
objects by multiple keys:  They keep multiple 
*indexes* with aliased references to the 
records.  

![Multiple indexes to student records](img_04_1/indexes.svg)

While search structures are the most common 
intentional use of aliasing, it is also 
useful sometimes for refactoring program logic.
 
Consider the simple game known as 
*noughts and crosses*
or [*tic tac toe*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).
Suppose the game board is represented by a 
list of lists of `Tile` objects, using letters 
*a* through *i* as position labels. 

```python
class Board:
    """Simple 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.tiles = [[Tile('a'), Tile('b'), Tile('c')],
                      [Tile('d'), Tile('e'), Tile('f')],
                      [Tile('g'), Tile('h'), Tile('i')]]

```

A game of noughts and crosses is won when 
there are three `X` or three `O` on tiles 
in any row, column, or diagonal.  We might 
use an `Enum` to represent the `X` and `O`
marks: 

```python
class Mark(Enum):
    xmark = "X"
    omark = "O"
    unmarked = "."
```
 
 
 The logic 
for checking for a win in a row might 
look something like this: 

```python
def row_is_winner(self, row_index) -> bool:
    mark_0 = self.tiles[row_index][0].mark
    mark_1 = self.tiles[row_index][1].mark
    mark_2 = self.tiles[row_index][2].mark
    if mark_0 == Mark.unmarked: 
        return False
    return mark_0 == mark_1 and mark_1 == mark_2
 ```

The logic for checking for a win in a 
column might look very similar: 

```python
def row_is_winner(self, col_index) -> bool:
    mark_0 = self.tiles[0][col_index].mark
    mark_1 = self.tiles[1][col_index].mark
    mark_2 = self.tiles[2][col_index].mark
    if mark_0 == Mark.unmarked: 
        return False
    return mark_0 == mark_1 and mark_1 == mark_2
```

Checking a diagonal would be yet again almost 
the same logic on different sets of tiles.  

Similar as these functions are, it is difficult 
to combine them if the `Tile` objects are arranged 
only in the single list-of-lists structure by 
row and column.   The logic can be factored easily, 
though, if we alias the same set of tiles from 
groups for rows, columns, and diagonals. 

![Grouping Tic-Tac-Toe Tiles](img_04_1/TicTac%20Groups.svg)

Now it is simple to write a single function to 
check whether a group is a winner: 

```python
def is_winner(group: List[Tile]) -> bool:
    """True if a win for *either* X or O"""
    q, r, s = group
    return (q.mark != Mark.unmarked
            and q.mark == r.mark
            and r.mark == s.mark)
```

It is easy to check all the rows, columns, 
and diagonals with a single loop: 

```python
    def has_winner(self) -> bool:
        """There is some winning row or column (for either X or O)"""
        for group in self.groups:
            if is_winner(group):
                return True
        return False
```

We have not really removed the 
complexity of traversing the board in three 
different orders, because we must traverse it 
to build the tile groups that represent those 
different orders.

```python
    def __init__(self):
        self.tiles = [[Tile('a'), Tile('b'), Tile('c')],
                      [Tile('d'), Tile('e'), Tile('f')],
                      [Tile('g'), Tile('h'), Tile('i')]]
        # 3-in-a-row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal
        self.groups = []
        # horizontal
        for row in self.tiles:
            self.groups.append(row)
        # vertical
        for col_i in range(3):
            group = []
            for row_i in range(3):
                group.append(self.tiles[row_i][col_i])
            self.groups.append(group)
        # diagonal left-to-right
        self.groups.append([self.tiles[i][i] for i in range(3)])
        # diagonal right-to-left
        self.groups.append([self.tiles[i][2-i] for i in range(3)])
```
  
  However, we need do that 
only once, as we do here in the constructor. 
We can separate that logic from 
the logic of checking for a winner.  The 
advantage becomes much larger if we use the 
groups in additional ways involving different 
logic.  For example, we might write another 
function to choose a tile to mark with an `X`
or `O`, selecting the best move by using the 
same groups.

```python
    def choose_for(self, mark: Mark) -> str:
        """Returns the most worthwhile position for
        mark to take, assuming it is the turn for
        mark and that there are open positions.
        """
        # We use the 'worth' field of the tiles to tally
        # how valuable each position is.
        for row in self.tiles:
            for col in row:
                col.worth = 0
        for group in self.groups:
            worth = calc_worth(group, mark)
            for tile in group:
                # No harm in granting worth to marked tiles
                tile.worth += worth
        # Pick open tile with max worth
        all_tiles = self.tiles[0] + self.tiles[1] + self.tiles[2]
        open_tiles = [tile for tile in all_tiles if tile.mark == Mark.unmarked]
        open_tiles.sort(key=lambda tile: tile.worth, reverse=True)
        return open_tiles[0].name
```

Notice that in the above method, we are looping 
through the same set of tiles in different ways. 
We first loop through by row and column to 
initialize the `worth` fields.  Then we loop 
through them in multiple orders using the 
`groups`, which refer to the very same `Tile` 
objects ordered by row, column, and diagonal. 

Note also that a single tile will be accessed 
multiple times in different groups, 
potentially accumulating 
`worth` each time it is accessed.  On the initially
empty board, a middle tile along one side 
will be accessed once in a row group and once 
in a column group, accumulating a total 
`worth` of 2. 

![The D tile appears in one row and one column](img_04_1/D-Worth.svg)

A corner tile accumulates worth from a row
group, a column group, and a diagonal group, 
because it can be used to form winning combinations 
in each of those groupings: 

![The G tile appears in a row, column, and diagonal](img_04_1/G-Worth.svg)

## Alternatives

The `groups` structure for aliasing groups 
of tiles in different orders 
is not the only way we could arrange
different access orders for the tiles.  
We could have written methods or 
functions to return lists of tiles in the 
desired order each time we needed them.  Python
also provides *generators*, which are identical
to functions except they may return several 
results, one at a time.  (The `range` 
function is actually a generator; it returns 
elements of the range one by one, not all 
together in a list.)  

The main advantage of building the `groups`
structure is that we only build it once, and 
then use it several times. 

## Summary

If there is more than one way of designating
("naming") the same object, we say the object 
is "aliased".   Aliasing immutable objects usually
has no observable effect, and often 
we design objects to be immutable so that we 
can alias them freely.  We must be careful when 
aliasing mutable objects, because a change to 
the object through one "name" will be observable
as a change to the object through any other 
"names" it may have. 

While aliasing can dangerous, it can also be useful. 
Sometimes we need different ways to designate 
the same set of objects, as when we traverse a 
collection repeatedly in different orders. And 
sometimes making a change to an object accessed 
through one name visible when the same object is
accessed through other names is exactly what we 
want.  We illustrated this by accumulating the 
"worth" of game tiles accessed in different 
orders.
