CIS 211 uses the same primary textbook as CIS 210, but we don't use much of it &mdash; we use the chapter
    that introduces objects and classes in Python and then quickly run off the end. These materials supplement
    the paper textbook.

Over the last two years teaching
    CIS 211, I have written extensive documentation of class projects, and more and more background material to
    accompany those projects. Starting Winter 2020 I intend to divide the documentation into two families of
    documents: 

* Background reading: Introduction to concepts and techniques, similar to a conventional textbook.
* Project documentation: Extensive HOWTO documents to guide you through each individual project.

The background reading will be posted here. You should read these
    *before*
    beginning an associated
    project, which generally means completing this reading them
    *before*
    the first lecture
    of each week. In-class quizzes will check your familiarity with this material, and lecture materials will
    assume you have prepared for lecture by doing the reading.


The HOWTO documents will be kept with the projects, typically in a &lsquo;docs&rsquo; subdirectory. You should read
    the
    HOWTO documents twice. Begin a project by skimming the entire associated HOWTO document, skipping over some details
    and getting
    just a sense of the overall project plan. Then begin the programming, starting the HOWTO document again from the
    start and reading in detail. Resist the tempt ation to skip over parts of the HOWTO, because even if you can
    complete
    some step without really understanding it, you will likely find a subsequent step very difficult to complete without
    full understanding of the steps that came before.</p>

## Work in Progress

This material is being constructed before and during winter term 2020.
    I will try to stay ahead of the class, but I may fall behind. I will certainly
    make many errors. If you spot an error, or suspect an error, please post a question to our Piazza discussion
    site.
