# HOWTO: Read me first

In this directory we keep instructions
for building the CS 211 (CS 162 in other Oregon colleges
and universities) open text using
Jupyter Book.   If you have forked the
repository to build your own version, or
if you just want to build your own copy,
start here. 

- Start.md :  Getting started by installing
  the software that supports Jupyter Book.
