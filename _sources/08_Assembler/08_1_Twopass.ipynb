    "Sometimes as you are working through one step \n",
    "in a loop, you find that you need information \n",
    "that will be available only on a subsequent step. \n",
    "Often the solution is to split your algorithm \n",
    "into two _passes_ through the data. \n",

    "Suppose we wished to _normalize_ these scores, replacing the raw score by a \n",
    "a ratio to the average (arithmetic mean) score.  (This is a very bad idea, \n",
    "but we will suppose it for the sake of the example.)  Since Cheri's score \n",
    "is 125% of the average score, her score should be represented as 1.25.  Since \n",
    "Ethan's score is 78% of the average score, his score should be represented \n",

    "## Summarizing in a Table\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we just needed a couple of variables \n",

    "variables, we may need a table of summary information. \n",
    "\n",
    "A typical real-life example requiring a table of summary \n",
    "information is producing cross references in text formatting. \n",
    "For example, the source code for a book to be formatted \n",
    "by the LaTeX document processing system might include \n",
    "a cross-reference entry like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",

    "\\Section{Binary Encoding Of Everything You can Imagine}\n",

    "Everything is binary.  Everything. That too. \n",

    "until we decide how to interpret it. \n",

    "\n",
    "The text formatting system has to essentially format the whole text twice. \n",
    "On the first pass it may discover that the label `sec:binary` appears on \n",
    "page 42.  This might be before or after the cross reference;  either way \n",
    "it saves the pair `(\"sec:binary\", 42)` in a table, and uses that table \n",
    "on the second pass when it can substitute the page number for the \n",
    "reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a less realistic but simpler example, suppose we have a list of fruits \n",
    "like this: \n",

    "\n",
    "Keeping a count is not difficult, but we need _two_ counts for each fruit: \n",
    "the total count, and the count of items encountered _so far_.  \n",
    "In the first pass through the list of fruits, we will produce the \n",
    "table of total counts: \n",
