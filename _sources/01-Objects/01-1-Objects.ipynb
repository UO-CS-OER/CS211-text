    "variables*, like `self.x` and `self.y` \n",
    "for the *x* and *y* coordinates of a point.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "What about defining an operation for moving a point?  Instead of \n",
    "adding `_point` to the name of a `move` function, we can just \n",

    "it looks like we passed it only one argument, `v`.  In fact \n",
    "we passed it both points:  `p.move(v)` passes `p` as the `self` argument and `v` as the `d` argument.  We use the variable \n",
    "before the `.`, like `p` in this case, in two different ways: To find the right method (function) to call, by looking inside the *class* to \n",

    "\n",
    "The `move` method above returns a new `Point` object at the \n",

    "wanted;  instead of `(3,4) + (5,6)` giving us `(8,10)`, it \n",

    "how we want `+` to act on `Point` objects.  We do this by \n",

    "## Magic for printing\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we wanted to print a `Point` object.  We \n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(f\"p is ({p.x}, {p.y})\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That would give us a reasonable printed representation, \n",

    "get wrong.  What if we just wrote \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(f\"p is {p}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "That would be simpler, but the result is not very \n",
    "useful: \n",

    "\n",
    "### `str()`d, not shaken\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to print `Point` objects as simply \n",
    "as we print strings and numbers, but we want the \n",
    "printed representation to be readable, we will need \n",
    "to write additional methods to describe how a \n",
    "`Point` object should be converted to a string. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, in Python we normally write two magic \n",
    "methods for this:  `__str__` describes how it \n",
    "should be represented by the `str()` function, \n",
    "which is the representation used in `print`\n",
    "or in an f-string like `f\"it is {p}\"`. We might \n",
    "decide that we want the object created by `Point(3,2)`\n",
    "to print as \"(3, 2)\". We would then write a \n",
    "`__str__` method in the `Point` class like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def __str__(self) -> str:\n",
    "        return f\"({self.x}, {self.y})\"\n",
    "```  \n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(f\"p is {p}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "we get a more useful result: \n",
