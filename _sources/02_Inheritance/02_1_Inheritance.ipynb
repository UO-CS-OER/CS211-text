    "\n",
    "Can we override methods any way \n",
    "we like?  For example, could we have have written \n",
    "the following definition of `translate` for \n",
    "class `Square`?\n",

    "    def translate(self, dx: Number, dy: Number) -> \"Square\":\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python would allow this, but it is a _very bad idea_. \n",
    "In Python, as in many object-oriented languages, \n",
    "we expect a *subclass* to also act as a *subtype*. \n",
    "\n",
    "What does it mean for one class to be a subtype \n",
    "of another?  The widely accepted answer is that \n",
    "a subtype may safely be used wherever its \n",
    "supertype could be used.  For example, if `Square`\n",
    "is not only a subclass of `Rect`, but also a \n",
    "subtype of `Rect`, then any code that would behave \n",
    "correctly with a value `v` that is a `Rect` should \n",
    "also act correctly if the value of `v` is a `Square`. \n",
    "We could say \"A `Square`s is a `Rect`s\", and in \n",
    "fact some programmers call subtyping the *is-a* relation. \n",
    "This is also called the *Liskov substitution principle*, \n",
    "for Nancy Liskov of M.I.T. who proposed it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a `Square` to be usable everywhere a `Rect` is usable, \n",
    "each method overridden in `Square` must be compatible with \n",
    "the corresponding method in `Rect`.  \n",
    "What does it mean for the `translate` of `Square` to be \n",
    "compatible with the `translate` of `Rect`?  Of course it \n",
    "should have the same number of arguments.  In addition, the \n",
    "arguments and return value should be compatible.  An argument \n",
    "in the overriding method is compatible if it accepts everything\n",
    "that the inherited method accepts, so it should be \n",
    "equal or a supertype of the argument type of the inherited \n",
    "method.  The result type should be what we would expect \n",
    "from the inherited method, so it should be equal or a \n",
    "subtype of the return type of the inherited method. \n",

    "## Abstract classes\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have used inheritance as a way to avoid \n",
    "repetitive code by reusing (inheriting) methods \n",
    "in subclasses.  Considering the Liskov substitution \n",
    "principle and the way subclasses are treated as \n",
    "subtypes, you might wonder whether sometimes it \n",
    "might be useful to create a superclass and a set \n",
    "of subclasses even though there is little or nothing\n",
    "to inherit.  Our purpose might be the subtype relation, \n",
    "knowing (and documenting) that any of the subtypes can \n",
    "be used where the supertype is expected. \n",
    "This is not only possible but common. \n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have a simple class `Rect` and a subclass \n",
    "`Square`, and although we overrode many of the \n",
    "`Rect` methods in `Square`, \n",
    "at least one method (`area`) is inherited.  Suppose \n",
    "now we also want a class `Triangle`.  A triangle is not\n",
    "defined by two corners, and its area is not computed \n",
    "in the same way as the area of a `Rect`.  And yet \n",
    "we can write an `area` method, with a completely different \n",
    "implementation, that is called in the same way and \n",
    "has the same meaning.  It is easy to imagine a loop \n",
    "that sums up the area of a mixed lists of triangles and \n",
    "rectangles.   It is useful for a class \n",
    " `Triangle` and class `Rect` to be subclasses of a \n",
    "single superclass `Shape`, even though there may be \n",
    "nothing that `Triangle` and `Rect` can inherit. \n",
    " \n",
    " What would this class `Shape` look like?  What could \n",
    "we do with an object of class `Shape`, if it makes \n",
    "sense at all to create `Shape` objects?  In fact, even \n",
    "though we want the *class* `Shape` to describe \n",
    "what \n",
    "`Rect`s and `Triangle`s have in common, we probably \n",
    "don't want to even make it possible to create a \n",
    "`Shape` object directly;  all `Shape` objects should \n",
    "be `Rect`s (including `Square`s) or `Triangle`s. \n",
    "\n",
    "A class like `Shape` that organizes a set of subclasses \n",
    "but which can never be instantiated to create objects \n",
    "by itself is called an *abstract base class*.  We \n",
    "might define shape as an abstract base class like this: \n",

    "```python\n",
    "class Shape:\n",
    "    \"\"\"An abstract base class that encompasses different concrete\n",
