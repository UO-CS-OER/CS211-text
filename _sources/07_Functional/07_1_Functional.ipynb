    "# Sometimes Functions are Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project for week 7 largely builds on \n",
    "concepts introduced earlier in the term,\n",
    "especially bitfield packing and unpacking but \n",
    "also objects with other objects as fields \n",
    "(e.g., the ALU and registers are part of the CPU, \n",
    "and the \n",
    "Memory is attached (\"wired\") to the CPU in the \n",
    "main program), the Model-View-Controller pattern \n",
    "attaching a graphical display to the CPU and memory \n",
    "state, some careful sequential logic to \n",
    "update the program counter register at the right \n",
    "point in the execution cycle. \n",
    "\n",
    "One small part that may seem unfamiliar is the \n",
    "way the ALU executes operations by looking them \n",
    "up in a table.  We have actually seen similar \n",
    "techniques a couple times before: \n",
    "\n",
    "* In the Agenda project, we passed a function to the \n",
    "  built-in `sort` method to order appointments by \n",
    "  start time: \n",
    "  `self.elements.sort(key=lambda appt: appt.start)`\n",
    "  \n",
    "* In the Calculator project, we used a table of classes to avoid \n",
    "  repetitive code while parsing the postfix expressions: \n",
    "  `stack.append(BINOPS[tok.kind](left, right))`\n",
    "  We called the classes in the \n",
    "  `BINOPS` and `UNOPS` tables to create \n",
    "  objects of the classes corresponding to each symbol like \n",
    "  `+` and `*`.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "In our simulation of the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) of the \n",
    "Duck Machine, we will use a table in which the keys are \n",
    "numeric operation codes and the values are functions indicated \n",
    "by those codes.  This is very analogous to the circuitry \n",
    "called a \"multiplexer\" that selects connections based on the \n",
    "values (1 or 0, positive voltage or no voltage) on some of its \n",
    "input wires. \n",
    "\n",
    "## When should we use functions as values? \n",
    "\n",
    "Some programming languages allow us to treat functions as \n",
    "values.  We can store functions in variables, pass functions to other \n",
    "functions, return functions from functions, etc.  When we can \n",
    "do this, we say that functions are _first class values_ in \n",
    "the programming language.  Python is such a language. \n",
    "\n",
    "In some other programming languages you will learn, functions may \n",
    "not be first class values.  Java, for example, has methods but \n",
    "not functions, and methods are not first class values (although \n",
    "recently a limited kind of first class function value, \n",
    "called a *lambda expression*, was added to Java).  \n",
    "In C you will encounter \n",
    "_function pointers_, which are first class values, although they \n",
    "are a little trickier to define and \n",
    "use than function objects in Python.  Each language you learn may be \n",
    "a little different in terms of whether and how you can treat \n",
    "functions as values. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use functions as values for some of the same reasons we use \n",
    "classes and subclasses in object oriented languages:  To simplify \n",
    "and generalize code, avoiding redundancy by factoring out \n",
    "the parts that are repetitive. Classes and subclasses may be \n",
    "more useful in some situations, and functions as values may be \n",
    "more useful in others: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Classes and subclasses are especially useful when there is a \n",
    "  natural subtype hierarchy to organize variation, such as \n",
    "  organizing our calculator expression classes as binary and \n",
    "  unary operations.   The object-oriented style is also useful \n",
    "  when we maintain complex state, such as the fields of \n",
    "  appointment objects in our agenda project. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Functions as values are sometimes more useful than classes \n",
    "  when functions are natural building blocks, especially when \n",
    "  we don't have as much need to maintain complex state. \n",
    "  Functions also make good building blocks even if state is complex\n",
    "  but more uniform than the functions we want to apply. \n",
    "  \n",
    "Sometimes either approach would be about equally applicable.  \n",
    "For example, in our calculator project, instead of creating \n",
    "several subclasses of the `BinOp` class, we could have created \n",
    "a single class with an instance variable holding the function \n",
    "to be applied.  The code would have been a little shorter, \n",
    "but whether it would have been simpler is arguable. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional Programming in Python \n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports both an object-oriented style of programming \n",
    "and a functional style of programming.  The object-oriented \n",
    "style is more common in large projects, but sometimes \n",
    "the functional style is just the tool we need to \n",
    "greatly simplify some code.  Two particularly useful \n",
    "tricks of the trade are storing functions in tables \n",
    "(dicts) and passing functions to functions or methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lambda is just shorthand\n",
    "\n",
    "Often when you encounter functions as values, they are \n",
    "written as lambda expressions, e.g., `lambda x: x + 1`. \n",
    "There is nothing complex or mysterious about lambda.  It \n",
    "is just shorthand for the familiar function function \n",
    "definition, e.g., \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def f(x): \n",
    "    return x + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The lambda expression doesn't have a name, but it is easy \n",
    "enough to give it one: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = lambda x: x + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The two definitions of `f` above, with a conventional function definition\n",
    "and with a lambda expression assigned to variable `f`, do \n",
    "precisely the same thing.  We simply use the lambda expression \n",
    "to avoid writing out the longer function definition, when \n",
    "it fits on one line, and especially \n",
    "when it doesn't need a name.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Beyond sum:  Reduce \n",
    "\n",
    "You may know that you can add up the elements of a list with the\n",
    "`sum` function: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we wanted to instead multiply all the elements, \n",
    "or count them?   We can write a single function for all \n",
    "of these, passing in the function by which the elements \n",
    "are all combined to obtain a single summary value. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def reduce(l: List[int], initial: int, f: Callable[[int], int]) -> int:\n",
    "    \"\"\" Reduce l by f, i.e., f(el, f(el, f(el, ...))) for el in l\"\"\"\n",
    "    reduction = initial\n",
    "    for el in l:\n",
    "        reduction = f(reduction, el)\n",
    "    return reduction\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The type hints are unwieldy (and would have been even more \n",
    "unwieldy if I had written a version that works for all kinds \n",
    "of lists, not just lists of `int`), but the code is simple: \n",
    "It just keeps applying a function over and over to distill the \n",
    "list to a single value.   To get a sum, I pass in a function \n",
    "(which I can write compactly using`lambda`) to add elements: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "li = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reduce with + is same as sum\n",
    "assert reduce(li, 0, lambda a,b: a+b) == 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If instead I want the product of all the elements, \n",
    "I pass in a function that multiplies: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Reduce with * is product of all elements\n",
    "assert reduce(li, 1, lambda a,b: a*b) == 120\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If I want to just count the elements, I can ignore the \n",
    "values and just add one at each step: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Trickier!  We can also get a 'count' function\n",
    "assert reduce(li, 0, lambda a,b: a+1) == 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course I am not limited to short nameless functions \n",
    "written with lambda.  I can find a maximum or minimum \n",
    "if I a careful about what to use as an initial value: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Max, min, or some other selection\n",
    "def larger(x, y):\n",
    "    \"\"\"For demo purposes only; built-in max is preferable\"\"\"\n",
    "    if x > y: return x\n",
    "    return y\n",
    "\n",
    "assert reduce(li, li[0], larger) == 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Walking a tree with a function value\n",
    "\n",
    "The `reduce` function described above was intriguing, but \n",
    "not really very useful since Python already gives us many \n",
    "reductions on lists including `sum`, `max`, etc.  However, \n",
    "we can use the same basic technique with other data structures, \n",
    "where the built-in Python functions are not applicable.  \n",
    "Let's consider a simple tree of integers with a `reduce`\n",
    "method: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Tree:\n",
    "    \"\"\"The abstract base class\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def reduce(self, f: Callable[[int, int], int],\n",
    "               leaf_val: Optional[int] = None):\n",
    "        \"\"\"f is a function for combining values of subtrees.\n",
    "        Leaves will return their own value unless leaf_val\n",
    "        is specified.\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        raise NotImplementedError(\"Each subclass must implement reduce\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Leaf(Tree):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, val: int):\n",
    "        self.val = val\n",
    "\n",
    "    def reduce(self, f: Callable[[int, int], int],\n",
    "               leaf_val: Optional[int] = None):\n",
    "        if leaf_val is None:\n",
    "            return self.val\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            return leaf_val\n",
    "\n",
    "class Inner(Tree):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, left: Tree, right: Tree):\n",
    "        self.left = left\n",
    "        self.right = right\n",
    "\n",
    "    def reduce(self, f: Callable[[int, int], int],\n",
    "               leaf_val: Optional[int] = None):\n",
    "        return f(self.left.reduce(f, leaf_val),\n",
    "                 self.right.reduce(f, leaf_val))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the `reduce` method with a function argument \n",
    "to implement different ways of summarizing values of the \n",
    "leaves, just as we did for a list: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "t = Inner(Inner(Leaf(1), Leaf(2)),\n",
    "          Inner(Leaf(3), Inner(Leaf(4), Leaf(5))))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sum leaves of tree\n",
    "assert t.reduce(lambda v,w: v+w) == 15\n",
    "# Product of leaves of tree\n",
    "assert t.reduce(lambda v,w: v*w) == 120\n",
    "# Max/Min leaf of tree using built-in max and min\n",
    "assert t.reduce(max) == 5\n",
    "assert t.reduce(min) == 1\n",
    "# Count leaves\n",
    "assert t.reduce(lambda x,y: x+y, leaf_val=1) == 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use as needed; Don't get carried away\n",
    "\n",
    "Function values are powerful, and sometimes they are just \n",
    "the right tool for the job.  Other times, you can accomplish \n",
    "the same thing with simpler approaches.  Many programmers \n",
    "find it difficult to read code that uses function values \n",
    "extensively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions or methods that take functions as arguments can be \n",
    "most useful when one such function can be used in place of \n",
    "several.  For example, if I only needed a method to sum \n",
    "the leaves of a tree, I would write a (recursive) `sum` method, \n",
    "and not a general `reduce` method.  But if I need `sum` and \n",
    "`product` and `max` and `min`, then a single `reduce` method \n",
    "becomes an attractive option.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen this in our prior projects that used function \n",
    "arguments and tables of functions or classes.  The table of \n",
    "classes in our calculator project replaced a chain of\n",
    "redundant `elif` ... \n",
    "`elif` ... `elif` clauses in our parser, so it was worthwhile.\n",
    "The table of operation functions in the ALU class for the \n",
    "Duck Machine simulator likewise allows us to avoid a chain \n",
    "of largely repetitive code.  \n",
    "The `key=` function argument to `sort` saves us from more \n",
    "complex ways of controlling the sort function.  Using functions \n",
    "as values (in tables, and as arguments to methods or functions)\n",
    "is worthwhile in these contexts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### There's more \n",
    "\n",
    "There is much more you can do with functions as values \n",
    "in Python.  For example, frameworks for web applications, like \n",
    "Django and Flask, create a table of functions for handling \n",
    "different URLs.  Both Django and Flask use Python _decorators_, \n",
    "which are functions that operate on other Python functions. \n",
    "Don't worry if that sounds confusing ... it's not something we're \n",
    "going to do in CIS 211.  But they are there for you sometime \n",
    "in the future when you need them. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can program for years in Python only occasionally encountering\n",
    "functions as values, and maybe managing to use them without \n",
    "really understanding them.  In some other languages, functions as \n",
    "values play a much more central role.  If you write web application \n",
    "code that executes in the browser, you are likely to encounter \n",
    "JavaScript code that uses functions as values.  You may also \n",
    "encounter some programming languages, like ML or Haskell, that \n",
    "are called \"functional languages\" because functions that \n",
    "combine other functions are as central to them as classes and \n",
    "objects are to Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes using a function as a value, in a table or passed \n",
    "as an argument to another function, can greatly simplify your\n",
    "code and remove redundancy.  Python is primarily an object-oriented \n",
    "language, not a functional language, and most of the time \n",
    "classes and objects give us the tools we need to solve problems. \n",
    "But sometimes a little bit of functional programming is a \n",
    "powerful addition. \n",
