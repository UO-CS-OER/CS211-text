    "# Negative Binary Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "In [the prior section](06_1_Bits) \n",
    "on binary representation and manipulation we \n",
    "discussed only positive integers and zero. \n",
    "Negative numbers complicate things slightly. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Representing a negative integer\n",
    "\n",
    "How should we represent -1 in binary?\n",
    "How about -42? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sign and magnitude: Seemed like a good idea at the time\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple approach would be to reserve one binary\n",
    "digit as a _sign bit_.  For example, in an 8-bit integer,\n",
    "10000001 could represent -1, and 10000101 could represent -5.  \n",
    "That is called _sign and magnitude_ representation.  It is \n",
    "simple, but it has some problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "In sign and magnitude representation we end up with 00000000\n",
    "for positive zero and 10000000 for negative zero.  But ... really, \n",
    "negative zero? This is a pretty clear indication that sign and magnitude \n",
    "representation is going to have other problems.  And it does. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the perspective of a computer designer, sign and magnitude \n",
    "representation adds a lot of \n",
    "complication to the circuitry needed for arithmetic.  Consider\n",
    "that somehow when we add $00000001_2$ (1)  and $10000001_2$ (-1) \n",
    "we should get $00000000_2$ (0).  The circuitry that adds \n",
    "positive integers is not going to do that, so special purpose \n",
    "circuitry for arithmetic on negative numbers would be required. \n",
    "Chip designers hate that. \n",
    "\n",
    "A representation that chip designers can be happy with should \n",
    "add as little complication as possible to CPU circuitry. Adding \n",
    "a negative number to a positive number, or a negative number \n",
    "to a negative number, should work exactly the same as adding \n",
    "two positive numbers.  Which brings us to two's complement \n",
    "notation. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Two's complement: A better way \n",
    "\n",
    "The representation for negative numbers actually used in virtually all modern\n",
    "digital computers is\n",
    "[two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement).   In this notation, the 8-bit representation of\n",
    "-1 is 11111111 and the 8-bit representation of 1 is, \n",
    "of course, 00000001.  If we add them, we \"carry the one\" all the way\n",
    "into the 9th (non-existant) digit, where it is lost, \n",
    "and we get 00000000.  Addition and subtraction can work in the ordinary way, with\n",
    "no special cases for negative numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The essence of two's complement representation is that, while the\n",
    "value of digit $p$ is normally $2^p$, the value of the\n",
    "very leftmost digit is $-2^p$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In an 8-bit signed integer, bit 7 represents $-(2^7)$, or -128. \n",
    "The signed 8-bit number 10000110, therefore, is \n",
    "$-(2^7) + 2^2 + 2^1$ = -128 + 4 + 2 = -122.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![-122 = -128 + 4 + 2](img_06_02/twos_comp.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "We said above that an 8-bit representation of -1 would \n",
    "be 11111111.  We can see that this is because the leftmost \n",
    "bit (still called the _sign bit_) represents -128, and the \n",
    "remaining bits represent 127, so that together they represent \n",
    "-1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Check your understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "If 11111111 is -1, what is the representation of -2? \n",
    "\n",
    "What range of values can be represented by by an 8-bit \n",
    "integer using the two's complement notation? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Python 'bin' lies about negative numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "If you count on the Python `bin` function to check \n",
    "the binary representation of integers, you will \n",
    "encounter a problem:  Python's `bin` function uses \n",
    "sign and magnitude notation, not two's complement, \n",
    "to represent a negative integer as a string of \n",
    "`0` and `1` characters.  In this way the Python \n",
    "`bin` function can always produce a string that starts \n",
    "with the character `1`, except for the binary value 0. \n",
    "It does not need to show the leading zeros on a positive \n",
    "integer, and it does not need to show a long string of `1`\n",
    "characters for a small negative integer. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> bin(-1)\n",
    "'-0b1'\n",
    ">>> bin(-2)\n",
    "'-0b10'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is usually convenient, especially considering the real internal \n",
    "representation of negative one in Python is likely to \n",
    "start with at least 31 1 bits. It can be misleading, \n",
    "however, when you are trying to reason carefully about \n",
    "the actual representation of negative numbers. \n",
    " \n",
    "## Sign extension\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when we describe the representation of a negative \n",
    "binary number, we need to say how many bits are in the \n",
    "representation.  The representation of -1 as an \n",
    "8-bit signed integer is 11111111, but the representation \n",
    "of -1 as a 16-bit signed integer \n",
    "is 1111111111111111.  I do not want to type the representation \n",
    "of -1 as a 32-bit signed integer, or as a 64-bit signed integer, \n",
    "but you can probably guess what it looks like. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have 3-bit signed integers. Then 101 \n",
    "represents $-2^2 + 2^0$ = -4 + 1 = -3.  Suppose I want to store \n",
    "this same value in a 5-bit signed integer. The \n",
    "new value will become 11101, that is, \n",
    "-16 + 8 + 4 + 1 = -3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Sign extending 3-bit negative integer to 5 bits](img_06_02/sign-extend-neg.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can likely see the pattern:  If we want to store a \n",
    "signed n-bit value in a larger m-bit field, we must \n",
    "pad with 1 digits on the left. \n",
    "More generally, what we pad with is the sign bit.\n",
    "Thus the 3-bit negative number 101 is padded out \n",
    "to the 5-bit negative 11101, while the 3-bit \n",
    "positive number 011 is padded out to the \n",
    "5-bit positive number 00011.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Sign-extending 3-bit positive integer to 5 bits](img_06_02/sign-extend-pos.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called \n",
    "_sign extension_. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we go the other way, we simply chop off bits on the \n",
    "left, whether they are 0 or 1.  If the bits we chop off\n",
    "are not all the same, and the same as the remaining sign \n",
    "bit, then the number does not fit in the smaller field! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Packing and extracting bit fields \n",
    "\n",
    "When we pack multiple values \n",
    "into an integer, we must be careful to \n",
    "determine whether that value should \n",
    "be interpreted as a _signed_ integer \n",
    " in which the leftmost bit is the sign bit, \n",
    " representing a negative power of 2, or \n",
    "an _unsigned_ integer in which all the bits\n",
    "represent positive powers of two. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we use four bits, bits 0..3, to \n",
    "represent an integer.  We might treat that field as an \n",
    "_unsigned_ integer that can range from 0 to 15, or we might \n",
    "treat it as a _signed_ integer that can range from -8 to 7. \n",
    "If we treat it as an unsigned integer, the masking and shifting\n",
    "can work exactly as described in the\n",
    "[the prior chapter](06_1_Bits.md), but we cannot represent \n",
    "negative values.  If we treat it as a signed \n",
    "integer, then we must add a sign extension step when we \n",
    "extract it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To pack a signed value into a field, we don't need to do \n",
    "anything special except be sure to mask the value to \n",
    "chop off any extra 1 bits on the left. For example, if we \n",
    "want to store a signed 3-bit value `x` in bits 3..5 of \n",
    "`w`, assuming those bits of `w` are initially zero, \n",
    "we would need to mask off any high bits, like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x_masked = x & 0b111\n",
    "x_shifted = x_masked << 3\n",
    "w = w | x_shifted\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is only on extraction that we must perform \n",
    "sign extension.  For example, if `x` in the \n",
    "preceding line was -1, and `w` is an 8-bit \n",
    "value 0, then `w` after the code \n",
    "above will contain `00111000`.  We want to extract \n",
    "the field in bits 3..5, holding value `111`, \n",
    "interpret it again as -1.  To do that, we must \n",
    "extend the sign bit (the initial 1) however \n",
    "far it takes to fill the word into which we are \n",
    "extracting that field.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing sign extension in Python is slightly odd. \n",
    "You must understand why and \n",
    "when to perform sign extension, but I will provide a \n",
    "sign extension function that you can call. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary \n",
    "\n",
    "In all modern digital computers, negative integers are \n",
    "represented with the _two's complement_ system.  In this \n",
    "system, the _sign bit_ represents a negative power of two, \n",
    "and all other bits represent positive powers of two.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Two's complement notation is very convenient and efficient \n",
    "for chip designers, because arithmetic with negative and \n",
    "positive numbers work exactly the same, with no extra \n",
    "circuitry.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we pack multiple small integers into an integer value, \n",
    "we must be careful about whether we intend a field to \n",
    "represent a signed value or an unsigned value.  If the \n",
    "field represents an unsigned value, then each bit $p$ \n",
    "represents $2^p$.  An unsigned value with $k$ bits \n",
    "ranges from $0$ to $2^k-1$.  \n",
    " If the field represents a signed \n",
    "value, then the _sign bit_ represents $-2^p$\n",
    "and all other bits $p$ represent $2^p$. \n",
    "\n",
    "When \n",
    "we pack a signed value into a smaller field, \n",
    "we mask off any extra 1 bits on the left. \n",
    "When we \n",
    "extract a signed value into a larger memory word, \n",
    "we must _sign extend_ it, filling all bits to the left of \n",
    "the sign bit of the smaller field with duplicates of the sign bit. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we use the Python `bin` function, we get a string \n",
    "representation based on sign and magnitude notation, \n",
    "and not an accurate representation of the actual \n",
    "internal two's-complement representation."
