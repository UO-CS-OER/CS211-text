# What the Hex?

Internally, modern digital computers use binary exclusively.  
Binary is cumbersome for humans.  I can tell at a glance 
that 27 is a little larger than 25, but it's a little 
harder to see that 11011 is a little larger than 11001. 

Most of the time we can ignore the internal binary representation. 
We mainly use decimal notation in our Python programs, 
for example.  Occasionally, though, we need a good way to 
write, read, and think about the binary representation, 
such as when we are shifting and masking values.  

Binary is cumbersome, because it requires so many digits.  
Decimal allows us to write numbers with fewer digits, 
but we cannot convert between decimal and binary in our 
heads (at least I can't).  Can we find a number system that 
is both easy to relate to binary and compact? 

## Casting a Hex

If we use a number base that is $2^k$, each digit in 
that number system will exactly represent $k$ 
binary digits.  10 is not a power of two, but 8 and 16 
are.  Two popular bases for representing binary numbers 
in human-readable form are octal (base 8) and hexadecimal 
(base 16), often called "hex".  Octal uses digits 0..7, and hexadecimal 
uses digits 0..9ABCDEF to represent values from 0 to 15. 
Hexadecimal, is particularly convenient 
because each hexadecimal digit represents 4 binary digits.
The smallest addressable unit of computer memory is typically 
the _byte_, which is 8 binary digits, and a byte can 
be represented by exactly two hexadecimal digits. For 
example, the binary number $01101011_2$
is $6B_{16}$.

## Hex Digit Values

The following table relates 4-bit binary numbers 
to hex digits and decimal values.  It is _not_
necessary to memorize this table, and most 
programmers don't.  You should, however, remember 
that $0_{16}$ is $0000_2$ and that $\textrm{F}_{16}$ is 
$1111_2$.  Since binary values are often grouped into 
8-bit _bytes_, it is also useful to remember that 
$\textrm{FF}_{16}$ is $1111\,1111_2$ or $255_{10}$.

## Hex notation in Python

Just as Python allows a number to be written in binary 
notation by prefixing it with '0b', Python allows a 
number to be written in hexadecimal notation by prefixing 
it with '0x'.  (If for some reason you wish to write a 
number in octal, prefix it with '0o'.) 

At the risk of repetition, I want to emphasize again that 
writing a number in hexadecimal notation does not mean that 
it is stored as a "hexadecimal number".  It is stored as a binary 
number, just as a number written in decimal notation is 
stored as a binary number. 

``` 
>>> 0x11
17
>>> 0x11 == 17
True
```

The `hex` function works like the `bin` function to produce a 
string of characters representing a value in hexadecimal 
notation. 

``` 
>>> hex(17)
'0x11'
```

## When you will see hex

By default, Python normally prints numbers is decimal. 
However, there are a few cases in which Python uses 
hexadecimal notation because it is likely to be useful 
to have a notion of the internal binary value.  One 
you may already be familiar with is the built-in `repr`
function for objects. 

``` 
>>> class JustAnExample: 
...    pass
...
JustAnExample()
<__main__.JustAnExample object at 0x1077f2f10>
```

This `repr` is telling us that the new object 
is at memory address $1077F2F10_{16}$.  We 
are unlikely to want to know the decimal value 
of that address.  We might, however, get some
use of knowing the hexadecimal value.  For example, 
it might help us understand the default `hash`
function for objects: 

``` 
>>> ob = JustAnExample()
>>> ob
<__main__.JustAnExample object at 0x1078030d0>
>>> hash(ob)
276300557
>>> hex(hash(ob))
'0x1078030d'
```
The decimal value provides us no useful information. 
Even if we had the memory address in decimal 
notation (4420808912), we would have a hard time 
seeing the relation between 4420808912 and 276300557. 
At a glance, though, we can see the relation between 
0x1078030d0 and 0x1078030d.  Clearly the hash value 
is just the memory address shifted right 4 bits! 

## Will you ever see octal? 

While octal is much less commonly used than hexadecimal, 
you are likely to encounter it occasionally when using 
Unix or Linux systems.  For example, octal codes can be 
used to set file read and write permissions in Unix
(but mnemonic alphabetic codes can also be used).  The use 
of octal in Unix is an historical artifact from computers 
of the 1970s.  If Unix were being designed for the first 
time today, I am confident its designers would have chosen 
hex rather than octal for representing bit patterns. 

## Summary 

It's all binary inside the computer, but binary is cumbersome 
for humans to read, write, and think about.  Hexadecimal, or 
just 'hex', conveniently uses one hex digit to represent four 
binary digits.   It is the most common notation used when we 
care about patterns of binary digits.
