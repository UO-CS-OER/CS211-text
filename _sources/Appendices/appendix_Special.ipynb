    "# Appendix -- Magic Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's *special* methods are also \n",
    "known as *dunder* methods, but most\n",
    "commonly they are referred to as \n",
    "*magic* methods.  They are methods \n",
    "that are implicitly invoked when \n",
    "certain operations are encountered \n",
    "(e.g., `a + b` is interpreted as \n",
    "`a.__add__(b)`) or when certain \n",
    "built-in functions are called \n",
    "(e.g., `len(a)` is actually a call \n",
    "to `a.__len()`).  The purpose of \n",
    "magic methods is to provide a convenient \n",
    "way to use simple, familiar \n",
    "syntax for both built-in classes \n",
    "like `int` and `float` and custom \n",
    "classes like `RomanNumerals`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Arithmetic Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation | Interpreted as  |\n",
    "|-----------| --------------- |\n",
    "| `a + b`   | `a.__add__(b)`  |\n",
    "| `a - b`   | `a.__sub__(b)`  |\n",
    "| `a * b`   | `a.__mul__(b)`  |\n",
    "| `a / b`   | `a.__truediv__(b)` |\n",
    "| `a // b`  | `a.__floordiv__(b)` |\n",
    "| `a % b`   | `a.__mod__(b)`  |\n",
    "| `a ** b`  | `a.__pow__(b)`  |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Augmented Assignment \n",
    "\n",
    "Often we use an arithmetic operation \n",
    "in combination with assignment, e.g., \n",
    "`x += 1` to increment x.  These are \n",
    "called *augmented arithmetic assignments*. \n",
    "The corresponding methods should \n",
    "update the `self` object and return it. \n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation  | Interpreted as   |\n",
    "|------------| ---------------- |\n",
    "| `a += b`   | `a.__iadd__(b)`  |\n",
    "| `a -= b`   | `a.__isub__(b)`  |\n",
    "| `a *= b`   | `a.__imul__(b)`  |\n",
    "| `a /= b`   | `a.__itruediv__(b)` |\n",
    "| `a //= b`  | `a.__ifloordiv__(b)` |\n",
    "| `a %= b`   | `a.__imod__(b)`  |\n",
    "| `a **= b`  | `a.__ipow__(b)`  |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparisons \n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison methods should return \n",
    "a result of type `bool`.  They are also \n",
    "called *rich comparison methods*. \n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation  | Interpreted as   |\n",
    "|------------| ---------------- |\n",
    "| `a < b`    | `a.__lt__(b)`    |\n",
    "| `a <= b`   | `a.__le__(b)`    |\n",
    "| `a == b`   | `a.__eq__(b)`    |\n",
    "| `a > b`    | `a.__gt__(b)`    |\n",
    "| `a >= b`   | `a.__ge__(b)`    |\n",
    "\n",
    "A `__ne__` method may also be implemented \n",
    "to perform the `!=` operation, but typically \n",
    "it is omitted.  If a class does not have \n",
    "a `__ne__` method, Python will interpret \n",
    "`a != b` by calling `a.__eq__(b)` and \n",
    "inverting the result.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*No other relations among comparisons are \n",
    "guaranteed.*   For example, if you provide\n",
    "a `__lt__` and a `__eq__` method for a class, \n",
    "you still need a `__le__` method if you \n",
    "want to be able to write `a <= b`.  Also, \n",
    "it is possible that `a.__lt__(b)` and \n",
    "`b.__lt__(a)` both return True, although \n",
    "this is likely to be a very bad idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although Python does not assume any relationships among comparisons \n",
    "like `<=`, `<`, and `==`, you don't need to implement each \n",
    "independently.  Suppose, for example, that you are defining a class \n",
    "of objects that are ordered by size.  You might have \n",
    "\n",
    "## Built-in Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Although listed in Python documentation \n",
    "as built-in functions, these are really\n",
    "calls to methods that are defined in all \n",
    "the built-in classes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "| Function call | Interpreted as  |\n",
    "|---------------| --------------- |\n",
    "| `abs(x)`      | `x.__abs__()`   |\n",
    "| `int(x)`      | `x.__int__()`   |\n",
    "| `float(x)`    | `x.__float__()` |\n",
    "| `str(x)`      | `x.__str__()`   |\n",
    "| `repr(x)`     | `x.__str__()`   |\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `str` and `repr` are often \n",
    "called implicitly.  When we write \n",
    "`f\"The value of x is {x}\"`, the \n",
    "`{x}` in the f-string is an implicit call to \n",
    "`str(x)` (and therefore an implicit\n",
    "call to `x.__str__()`).  When we \n",
    "type `x + y` in the Python console, \n",
    "Python first calls `x.__add__(y)`, \n",
    "and then calls `repr` on the result \n",
    "to print it, so what is actually \n",
    "printed at the console is \n",
    "`x.__add__(y).__repr__()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Collection Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides convenient notation \n",
    "for collections.  For example, if \n",
    "`d` is a `dict` objects, we can \n",
    "write \n",
    "`d[k]=v` to add the pair `(k,v)`\n",
    "`d` (replacing `(k,w)` if \n",
    "the key `k` was previously associated \n",
    "with `w`).  These operations are \n",
    "also implemented by magic methods. \n",
    "We can implement those methods in \n",
    "other ways to create custom \n",
    "collection classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation | Interpreted as   |\n",
    "| --------- | ---------------- |\n",
    "| `len(c)`  | `c.__len__()`    |\n",
    "| `_ = c[k]`| `c.__getitem__(k)` |\n",
    "| `c[k] = v`| `c.__setitem__(k,v)` |\n",
    "| `k in c`  | `c.__contains__(k)`|\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also lets us write \n",
    "`for v in c:` or `for k,v in c:` \n",
    "to loop through items in a \n",
    "collection.  This involves creation \n",
    "of an *iterator* object. If we have \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for k in c: \n",
    "   (do something with k)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "this is interpreted as \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i = c.__iter()__ \n",
    "try\n",
    "  while True: \n",
    "     k = i.__next__()\n",
    "     (do something with k)\n",
    "except StopIteration: \n",
    "  pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we build a *wrapper* class \n",
    "for a collection, in the object \n",
    "*wraps* another collection, \n",
    "we can often avoid the complication of \n",
    "writing a custom iterator class (the type \n",
    "of the object returned by `__iter__`)\n",
    "and just *delegate* to the iterator of \n",
    "the wrapped class.  For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Menagerie: \n",
    "   \"\"\"A list of animals\"\"\"\n",
    "   def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.animals = []\n",
    "\n",
    "   def __iter__(self):\n",
    "        return self.animals.__iter__()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional magic methods \n",
    "\n",
    "I have listed only the most common \n",
    "magic methods, leaving out some \n",
    "that we are unlikely to encounter \n",
    "in a introductory course.  A more complete list, \n",
    "with additional documentation can be \n",
    "found in the \n",
    "[*data model* chapter](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names)\n",
    "of the official Python documentation."
