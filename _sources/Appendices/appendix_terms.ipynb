    "#  Glossary of Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of terminology associated with object-oriented\n",
    "programming.  Often the same concept has different names (e.g., \n",
    "an _instance variable_ or _method_ may also be called an\n",
    "_attribute_).   There is no need to memorize all the terms in this\n",
    "glossary, but it may be helpful to you when you encounter a term\n",
    "that you haven't seen before or have forgotten. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please open an issue to request explanations of terms that you don't \n",
    "find here. \n",
    "\n",
    "## A \n",
    "\n",
    "abstract class\n",
    ": A class that cannot (or should not) be instantiated directly.\n",
    "An abstract class defines a common interface contract for one or\n",
    "more _concrete_ subclasses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "abstract base class\n",
    ":  Same as _abstract class_. \n",
    "\n",
    "attribute\n",
    ":  Component of a class or object.  A _method_ may \n",
    "be called a function attribute.  An _instance variable_ may be\n",
    "called a data attribute.  The `.` (\"dot\") operation accesses\n",
    "attributes, whether they are methods or variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "## C\n",
    "\n",
    "class\n",
    ": A template for creating and operating on objects.\n",
    "In Python 3, there is a one-to-one association between\n",
    "classes and types.  For example, the constant `7` is\n",
    "an `int` object, which means it has type `int` and also\n",
    "that `int` is the class that specifies how `int` objects\n",
    "are created and operated on.  Similarly, if you create a\n",
    "class `Point`,  objects created by calling `Point` will\n",
    "have type `Point`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## I\n",
    "\n",
    "inherit\n",
    ": If a class `C` has a method `m`, and a subclass `D` of `C`\n",
    "does _not_ have a method `m`, the definition of `m` in `C` \n",
    "is _inherited_ by class `D`, as if it had been copied from `C` into `D`.\n",
    "\n",
    "instance\n",
    ": An individual object.  We may create several distinct\n",
    "_instances_ from a class.  Each instance has its own set\n",
    "of _instance variables_.  For example, if `p` and `r` are\n",
    "instances of class `Point`, the `x` attribute\n",
    "(instance variable) of `p` might be 7, while the `x` attribute\n",
    "of `r` might be 19. \n",
    "\n",
    "instance variable\n",
    ": A variable that is stored as part of an object. It may\n",
    "also be called a _data attribute_.   Each object of some\n",
    "class is called an _instance_ of that class, and each instance\n",
    "contains its own _instance variables_.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## L\n",
    "\n",
    "Liskov substitution principle\n",
    ": In a nutshell, the _Liskov substitution principle_\n",
    "or _LSP_ (named for \n",
    "Nancy Liskov, a programming languages researcher) states that\n",
    "subclasses should behave like subtypes.  If `s` is a subtype of\n",
    "`t`, then we expect `s` to obey the specification of `t`, i.e., \n",
    "we should be able to use an `s` object anywhere a `t` object is \n",
    "specified.  For example, if we are looping through a list of `t` \n",
    "objects, mixing a few `s` objects into the list should not cause\n",
    "a problem.  Python does not enforce _LSP_.  It is up to the\n",
    "programmer to design subclasses so that they are fully compatible\n",
    "with their superclasses. \n",
    "\n",
    "## O\n",
    "\n",
    "override\n",
    ": If a class `C` has a method `m`, and a subclass `D` of `C`\n",
    "also has a method `m`, the definition of `m` in `D` _overrides_\n",
    "the definition in `C`.  If `c` is an instance of `C` and\n",
    "`d` is an instance of `D`, `c.m()` will execute the method `m`\n",
    "defined in `C`, but `d.m()` will execute the method `m` defined in `D`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## S \n",
    "\n",
    "subclass\n",
    ": A subclass of some class `C` is a class defined starting\n",
    "with `C` and the specifying differences, such as added _methods_\n",
    "and _instance variables_ or overridden methods.  In Python 3,\n",
    "a subclass is also a _subtype_. \n",
    "\n",
    "subtype\n",
    ": A subtype is a type associated with a subclass. If a program\n",
    "complies with the _Liskov substitution principle_, an instance\n",
    "of a subclass should be usable wherever an instance of its\n",
    "superclass is expected. \n",
    "\n",
    "superclass\n",
    ": If 'D' is a subclass of 'C', then 'C' is the superclass of 'D'.\n",
    "(Although Python permits a class to have more than one\n",
    "superclass through _multiple inheritance_, in our course we will\n",
    "restrict our attention to _single inheritance_, in which each class\n",
    "has exactly one superclass.)"
