    " CPython 3 works, \n",
    "but in less detail and with fewer assumptions about your background. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Translation and Execution \n",
    "\n",
    "CPython is an interpreter. That means it reads Python source code and then \n",
    "executes instructions that \"interpret\" the program.  In CIS 211 you  \n",
    "write an interpreter for a calculator, and in the final project you \n",
    "write a compiler for a simple language to run on the Duck Machine.  \n",
    "CPython is more complex, but not essentially different. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CPython interpreter works in two phases.  In the first phase, CPython \n",
    "translates Python source code into an intermediate, lower-level representation. \n",
    "The lower level representation is designed to be efficient for execution, \n",
    "and is not readily readable by humans. It is a sequence of instructions for \n",
    "a Python _virtual machine_, which is a program simulating a special purpose \n",
    "Python computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Python virtual machine, or byte code interpreter, is a simulated \n",
    "computer like our Duck Machine.  Unlike our Duck Machine, though, it \n",
    "is not designed to be simulate a real hardware computer.  It is instead \n",
    "an imaginary machine specialized for executing Python programs.  It doesn't\n",
    "have registers like the Duck Machine, but it has several data structures \n",
    "for managing Python program execution.  One of the key data structures \n",
    "is a _stack_.  Virtual machines like the one in CPython are called \n",
    "_stack machines_ because their _stack_ is used much the way \n",
    "registers are used in a physical computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the operations of the Python \n",
    "virtual machine is more complex than \n",
    "individual operations on the Duck Machine. \n",
    "Since the Python virtual machine is a stack \n",
    "machine, the byte code instructures are arranged \n",
    "in postfix order, much like the input of our calculator. \n",
    "For example, this small Python function: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def simple(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n",
    "    x = 11\n",
    "    c = a + b * x\n",
    "    return c\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "is translated into the following byte code instructions: \n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    "LOAD_CONST  1   # Push constant 11, which is at location 1\n",
    "STORE_FAST  2   # Pop and store in x, at location 2\n",
    "LOAD_FAST   0   # Push first argument a, found at address 0\n",
    "LOAD_FAST   1   # Push second argument b, found at address 1\n",
    "LOAD_FAST   2   # Push value of x \n",
    "BINARY_MULTIPLY # Pops values of x and b, pushes x*b\n",
    "BINARY_ADD      # Pops values x*b and a,  pushes a + x*b\n",
    "STORE_FAST  3   # Pop sum and store in variable c\n",
    "LOAD_FAST   3   # Push value of c, found at address 3\n",
    "RETURN_VALUE    # Pop value and return it\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not very clever code!  Note how it pops a value to store\n",
    "in variable `c`, then immediately pushes that value back on the \n",
    "stack before returning it.  When you write a code generator, \n",
    "do not despair over the quality of code you produce.  Code generators\n",
    "written by experts are pretty bad too.  (Language translators often \n",
    "have an optional _optimization_ phase that improves the generated \n",
    "code somewhat.)\n",
    "\n",
    "What does the `BINARY_ADD` byte code instruction do?  You already \n",
    "know:  It calls the `__add__` method on its operand.  This is a \n",
    "very complex operation compared to the simple operations performed\n",
    "by each instruction in a physical CPU. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Python translation compared to Java, C, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "Many language implementations use a two-step process \n",
    "much like Python.  If you have programmed in Java, \n",
    "the first part (translation to byte code) was what the \n",
    "`javac` program did, and the second part (executing \n",
    "the byte code) was what the `java` program did.  The \n",
    "Java virtual machine differs from the Python virtual \n",
    "machine in several regards, but it too is a stack machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some language implementations take a different approach, \n",
    "translating the source language (like C or C++) to \n",
    "the actual machine code of a physical machine. This is \n",
    "called \"compiling\" or \"compiling to native code\". \n",
    "The CPython interpreter itself is a C program that has \n",
    "been compiled to native code, which might be the machine \n",
    "code for an Intel x86 processor or the machine code for \n",
    "an ARM CPU (for example, if you run Python on a \n",
    "Raspberry Pi). \n",
    "\n",
    "In principle the same language can be translated in different \n",
    "manners.  There is nothing to prevent building an interpreter \n",
    "for C (and it has been done), and it is possible in principle \n",
    "to build a native code compiler for Python (but it's not easy). \n",
    "In practice, some language designs lend themselves to native \n",
    "code compilation, and some make it more difficult.  Python was \n",
    "designed to be an interpreted language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further reading:  There is a very nice, basic description of \n",
    "the Python virtual stack machine at \n",

    "\n",
    "## Key Data Types in CPython\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in object types in Python include integers, \n",
    "strings, lists, and dicts.  There is a built-in class \n",
    "for each of these.  The built-in classes are almost like \n",
    "classes you define in Python, but they are actually written \n",
    "in C. \n",
    "\n",
    "All Python objects, from integers to classes to strings, are \n",
    "represented by `PyObject` structures (`struct`) in the CPython\n",
    "code.   All `PyObject` structures have a header part, which contains\n",
    "a reference to its type (which in Python is a `class` object)\n",
    "and a _reference count_, used by the garbage collector.\n",
    "Information specific to each built-in type in Python follows the\n",
    "`PyObject` header.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class `list`\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python `list` is represented by a structure sometimes called a \n",
    "*flexible array*.  After the headers, elements of the list (which are \n",
    "always references to other objects) are stored in an array.  We call \n",
    "it a *flexible* array because the list has a capacity that may be \n",
    "greater than the number of elements currently in the list.  For\n",
    " example, if we had a list with two elements  \n",
    "\n",
    "![List object](img_internals/list-concept-2elem.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "the `append` method would use the next available space in the array\n",
    "and update information in the list headers part of the structure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Appending one more](img_internals/list-concept-3elem.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes the `append` and `pop` methods very efficient if you always\n",
    "append and pop at the end of the list.  If the capacity of the list \n",
    "is exhausted, appending a new element requires allocating a larger \n",
    "flexible array. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Grow the array](img_internals/list-concept-4elem.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The details are a little more complicated.  First, a `list` object, \n",
    "like all Python objects, starts with a header that identifies the \n",
    "type of the object and holds some bookkeeping information for the \n",
    "garbage collector (the component that recycles unused objects).\n",
    "Second, Python can't just put the flexible part of the object adjacent\n",
    "to the header in memory, because there might not be available space to \n",
    "expand it when its capacity is exhausted.  So, instead, the header \n",
    "contains a pointer to the variable part.  When we expand the capacity \n",
    "of the flexible array, we discard the old area (allowing the garbage \n",
    "collector to recycle it) and allocate a new one. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Expanding the flexible array representation](img_internals/list-object-append.*)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python never moves object headers.  This is so that an object reference \n",
    "in Python can be represented simply as a memory address.  If object\n",
    " headers\n",
    " moved around, references would either need a more complex\n",
    "  representation, or \n",
    " else all references to an object would need to be modified when the\n",
    " object header moved.  In consequence, all the mutable container\n",
    " classes of Python (lists, dicts, sets, strings) have a fixed header\n",
    " with a pointer to the part that can grow. \n",
    " \n",
    "### Class `int`\n",
    "\n",
    "Although memory hardware is not really \"typed\", CPUs have \n",
    "operations like ADD that treat values as integers.\n",
    "Most programming languages have an integer type that \n",
    "is essentially just a 32-bit or 64-bit integer exactly \n",
    "as supported by the hardware.  Python's `int` class is \n",
    "different.  A Python `int` is actually an object wrapper for \n",
    "a variable length list of integers.  Python uses this \n",
    "representation so that it can deal with very large numbers, \n",
    "even larger than 64 bits which is typically the upper \n",
    "limit for integers in languages like Java and C. \n",
    "When you add two large integers, Python may actually execute \n",
    "a loop to add up corresponding parts!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the `int` class really is a class, it has methods \n",
    "like any other class.  When we add `int` objects, we call the \n",
    "`__add__` method just like we would if we were adding strings \n",
    "(whose `__add__` method concatenates strings).  The `__add__`\n",
    "method for `int`, and all the other arithmetic methods for `int`, \n",
    "are implemented in C.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While some `int` objects may have more digits than others, and \n",
    "therefore occupy more a larger area of memory, `int` objects never\n",
    "have to grow because they are *immutable*.  When you add 329 and 41, \n",
    "you do not change 329 or change 41, but rather create a new `int`\n",
    "object to hold the value 370. Because they are immutable, an `int`\n",
    "object need not be split into a fixed part and a variable part \n",
    "like a `list` object. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the standard integer representation in all modern \n",
    "computers I am aware of uses 2s complement representation \n",
    "for negative numbers, Python uses sign and magnitude\n",
    "representation.  The magnitude is represented by a sequence\n",
    "of 30-bit \"digits\". The number of digits is stored in the \n",
    "header of the `int` object.  Since the number of digits can\n",
    "never be negative, a digit count of $-k$ is used to indicate\n",
    "that there are $k$ digits and the value is negative.  For\n",
    "example, a very large negative integer might have a size field\n",
    "of $-3$, indicating that it requires three 30-bit digits (each \n",
    "of which is represented as a non-negative integer) and that the value\n",
    "is negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "![A negative integer with 3 30-bit digits](img_internals/int-neg-3digits.*)\n",
    "\n",
    "The sign and magnitude representation and variable length\n",
    "complicate every arithmetic operation,\n",
    "but the interpreter uses some clever tricks to make arithmetic \n",
    "on small numbers reasonably efficient.  There are special cases in the\n",
    "interpreter code for integers small enough to fit entirely in a 32-bit\n",
    "machine word.  Python also keeps a stash of common small values that\n",
    "it reuses so that it doesn't have to create as many new `int` objects.\n",
    "Nevertheless arithmetic in Python is much, much slower than arithmetic\n",
    "in a language like C or Java.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You might be aware that a lot of scientific computing is done in\n",
    " Python,\n",
    " and you might wonder how that can be feasible given the very\n",
    " inefficient (but flexible!) representation of `int`.  The answer is\n",
    " that high performance scientific programs do not depend too\n",
    " heavily on the built-in Python `int` type (nor even on `float`).\n",
    " Scientific computing relies heavily on the `scipy` and `numpy\n",
    " ` libraries,\n",
    " which provide their own implementation of arrays and matrices of\n",
    " numbers.  The numbers in those arrays and matrices are not Python\n",
    " `int` or `float` numbers, but rather a more basic, less flexible\n",
    " representation, exactly as you would find in C or C++ code (and in\n",
    " fact implemented in C). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class `dict`\n",
    "\n",
    "A `dict` is implemented as a *hash table*.  Like a list, it is a\n",
    "container class that might need to be expanded as items are added, \n",
    "so it is broken into a head part with a fixed address and a\n",
    "content part of \"payload\" that can be reallocated with a larger\n",
    "capacity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Hash tables (called \"hashmaps\" in Java) are a form of \"scatter\n",
    " storage\".   Let's consider the dict `{ \"dog\": 22, \"cat\": 13 }`, \n",
    " and assume the `dict` structure initially has room for 5 (key, value)\n",
    " pairs.\n",
    " \n",
    " ![`{\"dog\": 22, \"cat\": 13}`](img_internals/dict-2elem.*)\n",
    " \n",
    " The _items_ part of the structure\n",
    " holds the (key, value) pairs (which are \n",
    " actually references to other objects).\n",
    " Each new entry is just appended, as in the \n",
    " `list` structure.  Indexes of their positions are\n",
    " scattered in the _index_ part of the structure.\n",
    " The scattering is determined by a _hash function_.\n",
    " A hash function (or just _hash_) of a key is a\n",
    " function that maps the key deterministically to a\n",
    " value that is somewhat random (but always the same\n",
    " for a given key). For example, `hash(\"dog\")` might return 28. \n",
    " There are only 8 slots in the index, so we take\n",
    " 28 mod 8 to compute the index 4.  Slot 4\n",
    " of the index part contains 0,\n",
    " indicating that the entry for \"dog\" is in slot 0\n",
    " of the _items_ part of the structure.  \n",
    " \n",
    " Suppose we give the command `d[\"lizard\"] = 18` to add \n",
    " (\"lizard\", 18) to the hash table.  Maybe `hash(\"lizard\")`\n",
    " returns 36.  36 mod 8 is 4, the same as 28 mod 8, and\n",
    " slot 4 of the index already contains a reference to the entry\n",
    " for (\"dog\", 22).  This is called a _hash collision_ or\n",
    " just _collision_, because the hash indexes for\n",
    " \"dog\" and \"lizard\" have _collided_ at slot 4.\n",
    "What should we do?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses a\n",
    " _collision resolution_ approach called _open addressing_.\n",
    " You might also summarize it as \"if once you don't succeed,\n",
    " try, try again\".  Slot 4 is taken, so Python adds something\n",
    " to the index, again reduces it modulo the number of elements\n",
    " in the index portion of the structure, and tries again.\n",
    " Let's say it adds 5, so it next tries slot (5 + 4) mod 8,\n",
    " which is 1.  But slot 1 is also in use!  So it adds a larger\n",
    " number, maybe 197.  (197 + 1) mod 8 is 6, so it tries \n",
    " slot 6.  That slot is empty, so it stores 2 in that slot to\n",
    " indicate that slot 2 in the items part is where (\"lizard\", 18)\n",
    " can be found.\n",
    " \n",
    "![Adding a lizard](img_internals/dict-3elem.*)\n",
    " \n",
    " If we write `x = d[\"lizard\"]`, the same set of _probes_ occurs:\n",
    " We hash \"lizard\" and get 36 % 8, and looking in slot 4 of\n",
    " the indexes we find 0.  We check slot 0 of the items part, but\n",
    " instead of \"lizard\" we find \"dog\".  Next we add 5, which leads\n",
    " us to check entry 1, but we find \"cat\" instead of \"lizard\".  Finally\n",
    " we try slot 6 of the indexes, which leads us to slot 2 of the items,\n",
    " where we find (\"lizard\", 18).  If we instead landed on an empty\n",
    " slot in the indexes, we would conclude that there was no key \"lizard\"\n",
    " and raise a key error. \n",
    " \n",
    " Note that in our example, the capacity of the hash table is \n",
    " 5 items, but there are 8 slots in the index part of the\n",
    " structure.  We want to minimize the number of collisions, and we\n",
    " want the _probe sequences_ (like the sequence 4, 1, 6 for \"lizard\")\n",
    " as short as possible, but without wasting too much space.  At present\n",
    " Python 3 allocates about 1.5 times as many index slots as\n",
    " elements.  It uses a quadratic probe sequence that ensures that,\n",
    " if there is at least one empty index slot, it will always be\n",
    " found eventually.  The variable size portion of the dict structure\n",
    " is reallocated whenever the items part is exhausted, so there will\n",
