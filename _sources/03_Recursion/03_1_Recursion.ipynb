    "# Recursion in Object-Oriented Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "You've seen and written recursive functions before.  The same \n",
    "basic concepts apply in object-oriented programs with classes\n",
    "and objects, but with a twist:  The data structure often \n",
    "has the same \"shape\" as the recursive function, and the \n",
    "parts of the recursive function are often divided between \n",
    "methods in different subclasses. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Review of Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that a recursive function is divided into one or \n",
    "more *base cases* and one or more *recursive* or *inductive* cases. \n",
    "Together these have a fairly standard structure.  In pseudocode:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def recursive_function(value): \n",
    "    \"\"\"We always check base cases first\"\"\"\n",
    "    if base case applies: \n",
    "       do the base case and return\n",
    "    elif another base case applies: \n",
    "       do the base case and return\n",
    "    else \n",
    "       \"\"\"Recursive case(s) follow\"\"\"\n",
    "       break value into pieces p1, p2, ...\n",
    "       r1 = recursive_function(p1)\n",
    "       r2 = recursive_function(p2)\n",
    "       ...\n",
    "       return combination of value, r1, r2, ...\n",
    "```       \n",
    "        \n",
    "For example, the classic *factorial* example can be written as \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def classic_factorial(value: int) -> int:\n",
    "    \"\"\"We always check base cases first\"\"\"\n",
    "    if value < 2:\n",

    "       return value * r1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which we would typically simplify to \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see the same basic structure in a \n",

    "## Recursive Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "A data structure can also have a recursive structure: Tuples can contain tuples, lists can \n",
    "contain lists, dicts can contain dicts, etc.   Instead of a simple list, we could make \n",
    "the table have four elements: \n",
    "\n",
    "![Schema of nested list search structure](img/greek-search-schema.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "where *smaller keys* and *larger keys* are themselves tables with the \n",
    "same form, lists within lists, so that we get \n",
    "\n",
    "![Nested list form of search structure](img/greek-search-example.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the table could be represented as \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "alpha_tree = [4, \"gamma\",\n",
    "              [3, \"beta\",\n",
    "               [1, \"alpha\", [], []],\n",
    "               []],\n",
    "              [12, \"epsilon\",\n",
    "               [9, \"delta\", [], []],\n",
    "               [15, \"zeta\", [], []]]\n",
    "              ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We would typically visualize this structure not by \n",
    "drawing list cells within list cells, but by drawing the \"nested in\" \n",
    "relation as lines.  We call such a structure a *tree*, with the \n",
    "*root* of the tree at the top. \n",
    "Each entry in the tree is called a *node*.\n",
    "Every node except the \n",
    "root is connected to a single *parent* above it. \n",
    "A node may be connected to one or more *children* \n",
    "below it.  A node without children is called a \n",
    "*leaf*, and other nodes are called *internal nodes*. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Table drawn as a tree](img/greek-search-tree.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this diagram key 4 is at the root.  Keys 1, 9, and 15 are in leaves, \n",
    "and 4, 3, and 12 are internal nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can rewrite our binary search as a search in the nested list structure, or tree:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def nested_list_search(key: int, table: list) -> str:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Table is [key, value, smaller keys, larger keys]\"\"\"\n",
    "    log.debug(f\"Search for {key} in {table}\")\n",
    "    \"\"\"Base case 1: There are no keys\"\"\"\n",
    "    if table == []:\n",
    "        return \"No such value\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    entry_key, entry_value, smaller, larger = table\n",
    "    \"\"\"Base case 2: Key is found\"\"\"\n",
    "    if key == entry_key:\n",
    "        return entry_value\n",
    "\n",
    "    if key < entry_key:\n",
    "        \"\"\"Recursive case 1: Must be in the smaller keys\"\"\"\n",
    "        return nested_list_search(key, smaller)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        \"\"\"Recursive case 2: Must be in the larger keys\"\"\"\n",
    "        return nested_list_search(key, larger)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this is almost the same logic as our binary search in a list. \n",
    "The differences are that now the data is \"shaped like the algorithm\".  \n",
    "When we searched a sorted list, we divided the list into a middle element, \n",
    "a sublist of smaller elements, and a sublist of larger elements.  The nested \n",
    "list has already been divided up into a middle element (which appears in the \n",
    "first key and value), a sublist of smaller elements, and a sublist of larger \n",
    "elements.  Instead of calculating a midpoint, our `nested_search_list` just\n",
    "follows the data structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Hierarchical Structure as Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "We can implement the same logical structure using classes and objects.  Note that when \n",
    "we represented the tree using nested lists, we used empty lists to represent empty \n",
    "sets of entries with larger or smaller keys.  Using classes, we can instead \n",
    "create a distinct subclass for an empty table.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create an abstract base class for the tree structure, with a \n",
    "concrete subclass for a non-empty node and a concrete subclass for \n",
    "an empty node: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class GreekSearchTree:\n",
    "    \"\"\"An abstract base class for the table of Greek letters\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",

    "\n",
    "class Empty(GreekSearchTree):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With these classes we can build up the tree structure: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The leaves\n",
    "empty = Empty()  # I really only need one of these\n",
    "alpha = Node(1, \"alpha\", empty, empty)\n",
    "delta = Node(9, \"delta\", empty, empty)\n",

    "gamma = Node(4, \"gamma\", beta, epsilon)\n",
    "# (4, gamma) is at the root\n",
    "tree = gamma\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What about a search method?  In the abstract \n",
    "base class, we will give a method definition with \n",
    "the header for the search method. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "    \"\"\"An abstract base class for the table of Greek letters\"\"\"\n",

    "        raise NotImplementedError(\"Concrete classes must override the search method\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll override that search method for the \n",
    "non-empty node class: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Node(GreekSearchTree):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, key: int, value: str, smaller: GreekSearchTree, larger: GreekSearchTree):\n",
    "        self.key = key\n",

    "            return self.larger.search(key)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this `search` method we see one of the base cases \n",
    "(when the key is found) and the recursive cases \n",
    "for searching in the subtree of smaller keys \n",
    "or the subtree of larger keys.  But where is the \n",
    "other base case?\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we see the one big difference between recursive \n",
    "functions and recursion in methods in a recursive \n",
    "structure of objects.   In the function, we always \n",
    "used some kind of decision (typically an `if` statement)\n",
    "to distinguish the base cases and recursive cases.  \n",
    "Typically the cases are distributed among\n",
    "different subclasses, and part or all of the choice \n",
    "of which cases to execute are controlled by \n",
    "which kind of object the method is called in. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example search for key 10.  \n",
    "Initially we call the 'search' method on the \n",
    "root object, with key 4. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Start the search at the root](img/greek-search-step1.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The key 10 is greater than the key in that node, \n",
    "so the recursive part of the `search` method is \n",
    "invoked on `self.larger`, which is the subtree \n",
    "with key 12 at its root. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Recursive search on subtree rooted at 12](img/greek-search-step2.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now key 10 is smaller than the key in the node, \n",
    "so it makes a recursive call to \n",
    "`self.smaller.search(key)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Recursive search on subtree rooted at 9](img/greek-search-step3.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now key 10 is larger than the key in the node, \n",
    "so once again it makes a recursive call on \n",
    "`self.larger.search(key)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Recursive search on empty subtree](img/greek-search-step4.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This time we get the method `search` with \n",
    "class `Empty`.  We don't have to use an `if` \n",
    "statement to determine that this is a base case. \n",
    "We know it is a base case because that is the only \n",
    "case that this `Empty` node could be asked to handle! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Other Recursive Structures and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "*Search trees* like the table illustrated above are \n",
    "one important group of tree structures in software, \n",
    "but far from the only one.  Often trees represent \n",
    "hierarchical \"part-of\" structures.  Examples \n",
    "include geographic areas (country comprised of \n",
    "states or provinces, states made up of counties, \n",
    "counties further divided into precincts), \n",
    "graphics (a scene made up of shapes, with \n",
    "composite shapes and made up of simpler shapes, \n",
    "and simple line segments, points, and polygons\n",
    "as leaf nodes), documents (a book made up of chapters,\n",
    "chapters made up of sections, sections made up \n",
    "of paragraphs, paragraphs made up of lines) and so on. \n",
    "There is hardly an application domain in which \n",
    "tree structures do not find some use in software. \n",
    "\n",
    "Wherever we find trees, we are likely to find some \n",
    "methods that *walk* or *traverse* the trees \n",
    "recursively.  Sometimes these are some form of search, but \n",
    "not always.  Many of the functions we might write \n",
    "for a list are also needed for a trees.  With a list, \n",
    "we might have a choice between recursion and a simple\n",
    "loop.  For example, the recursive binary search \n",
    "of a list could also be written without recursion, \n",
    "using a loop.  The loop version of binary search is \n",
    "hardly more complex than the recursive version, and \n",
    "apt to execute a little faster.  With tree structures, \n",
    "on the other hand, recursion is usually the better \n",
    "choice.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One widely used tree structure that you may \n",
    "have encountered already, and certainly will in the \n",
    "future, is the Document Object Model (DOM) of HTML. \n",
    "This is the data structure that a web browser \n",
    "constructs from the HTML source code of a web page, \n",
    "and it is the structure that style sheets and \n",
    "scripts consume and manipulate to support all the \n",
    "interactive effects of modern web applications. \n",
    " \n",
    "Consider a very simplified version of the DOM \n",
    "structure.  Each \"<tag>...</tag>\" segment \n",
    "would be represented by a node in the tree. \n",
    "Content that is plain text, with no tags, \n",
    "might be leaf nodes.  We would begin with an\n",
    "abstract base class for DOM tree nodes: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class DOMNode:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Abstract base class, defines the interface\n",
    "    that concrete DOM node classes must conform to.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        raise NotImplementedError(\"Abstract constructor of DOMNode\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We might define several other methods that all \n",
    "DOM nodes should implement, but for the example we'll\n",
    "consider only the simple magic methods like \n",
    "`__str__`, which have default definitions already \n",
    "inherited from class `object`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The internal nodes of the DOM have tags (like \n",
    "`h1`, `h2` etc. for \"header\" elements and \n",
    "`p` for paragraphs).  These tagged sections \n",
    "may be nested.  This is represented by giving \n",
    "each node a *list* of children.  (Contrast this \n",
    "to our search tree, in which each internal node \n",
    "had exactly two children.) \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Tagged(DOMNode):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, tag: str, children: List[DOMNode] = []):\n",
    "        self.tag = tag\n",
    "        self.children = children\n",
    "\n",
    "    def append(self, node:DOMNode):\n",
    "        self.children.append(node)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "How shall we define the `__str__` method for a \n",
    "tagged node?  Let's make it look like html, \n",
    "in which begin-tags like `<p>` are paired with \n",
    "end-tags like `</p>`. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def __str__(self) -> str:\n",
    "        \"\"\"Text form is like HTML source code\"\"\"\n",
    "        parts = [str(part) for part in self.children]\n",
    "        return f\"<{self.tag}> {' '.join(parts)} </{self.tag}>\\n\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the `__str__` method uses f-strings \n",
    "that implicitly make calls on the `__str__` methods \n",
    "of the children of a `Tagged` node.  Thus producing \n",
    "the text for a DOM tree is recursive.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Plain text nodes, which will always be leaves of \n",
    "the DOM, will be simple: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Plain(DOMNode):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Plain text content is essentially just a string\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, text: str):\n",
    "        self.text = text\n",
    "\n",
    "    def append(self, text: str):\n",
    "        self.text += text\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        return self.text\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where we have a recursive tree traversal, \n",
    "leaf node classes usually handle a base case. \n",
    "For creating a string representation, the \n",
    "`__str__` methods implement a recursive walk \n",
    "over the tree, and we can see that the simple \n",
    "`__str__` method of `Plain` is a base case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can build a DOM tree with calls to \n",
    "the constructors of `Tagged` and `Plain`: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "page = Tagged(\"html\",\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic logic of recursion is the same for \n",
    "object-oriented programs as for recursive \n",
    "functions that do not involve classes and objects. \n",
    "Just as before, we must identify one or more \n",
    "base cases and one or more recursive cases that \n",
    "build up complete results from simpler cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference is that with classes and objects, \n",
    "the recursive structure of the algorithms is often \n",
    "the same as the recursive structure of the objects.\n",
    "Often we will have the base case in one subclass \n",
    "and the recursive case in another subclass.  Instead\n",
    "of writing an `if` statement to control which case \n",
    "applies, we simply let each class take care of the \n",
    "part of the logic that belongs to it.   When a leaf\n",
    "node and an internal node both have a method `m`, \n",
    "usually the method `m` in the leaf node class will \n",
    "handle only the base case, and the method `m` in the \n",
    "internal node class will handle only the recursive \n",
    "case. \n",
